935,The SHiP experiment at CERN,"SHIP is a new general purpose fixed target facility, whose Technical Proposal has been recently reviewed by the CERN SPS Committee and by the CERN Research Board. The two boards recommended that the experiment proceeds further to a Comprehensive Design phase in the context of the new CERN Working group ""Physics Beyond Colliders"", aiming at presenting a CERN strategy for the European Strategy meeting of 2019. In its initial phase, the 400GeV proton beam extracted from the SPS will be dumped on a heavy target with the aim of integrating 2×10^20 pot in 5 years. A dedicated detector, based on a long vacuum tank followed by a spectrometer and particle identification detectors, will allow probing a variety of models with light long-lived exotic particles and masses below O(10) GeV /c2. The main focus will be the physics of the so-called Hidden Portals, i.e. search for Dark Photons, Light scalars and pseudo-scalars, and Heavy Neutrinos. The sensitivity to Heavy Neutrinos will allow for the first time to probe, in the mass range between the kaon and the charm meson mass, a coupling range for which Baryogenesis and active neutrino masses could also be explained. Another dedicated detector will allow the study of neutrino cross-sections and angular distributions. ντ deep inelastic scattering cross sections will be measured with a statistics 1000 times larger than currently available, with the extraction of the F4 and F5 structure functions, never measured so far and allow for new tests of lepton non-universality with sensitivity to BSM physics.",2017-08-23 14:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,Workshop on Future of Fundamental Physics - Accelerators in HEP and beyond,Walter Marcello Bonivento,
936,On the relationship between electromagnetic curvature and acceleration of charges,"Faraday introduced electric field lines as a powerful tool for understanding the electric force, and field lines are still used today in classrooms and textbooks teaching the basics of electromagnetism within the electrostatic limit. However, despite attempts at generalizing this concept beyond the electrostatic limit, there is currently no field line theory that can be consistent with the complete theory of electromagnetism.    This work will discuss the notion of covariant electromagnetic field lines. We will show that it naturally extends electric field lines to general relativistic systems and derive a closed-form formula for the field lines curvature.    The curvature of electromagnetic field lines completely determines the dynamics of any electric charge and may entail new insights regarding long-standing problems such as radiation-reaction and self-force. In particular, the electromagnetic field lines curvature has the attractive property of being non-singular everywhere, thus eliminates all self-field singularities without using renormalization techniques.    Time permitting, the relationship between field lines curvature to gravity and/or quantum system will be discussed.",2017-08-23 14:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,"D Cosmology, Astrophysics, Gravity, Mathematical Physics",Yaron Hadad,
939,Indirect dark-matter searches with gamma-rays experiments : status and future plans from 300 KeV to 100 TeV,"Detection of gamma rays and cosmic rays from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles is a promising method for identifying dark matter, understanding its intrinsic properties, and mapping its distribution in the universe. I will review recent results from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and other space-based experiments, and highlight the constraints these currently place on particle dark matter models. I will also discuss the prospects for indirect searches to robustly identify or exclude a dark matter signal using upcoming experiments at energies below Fermi ( ASTROGAM ) and above Fermi:  Magic, H.E.S.S.

940,Equation of state of quark gluon plasma using a phenomenological model,"We work on equation of state (EoS) of quark gluon plasma using a simple phenomenological model. In this model, a dynamical quark mass is used as a finite value. The results are significant and agree well with other theoretical results.",2017-08-26 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,yogesh kumar,
941,Wave function collaspe and gravity,"To make quantum theory consistent, models of spontaneous wave function collapse (collapse models) propose to modify the Schrödinger equation by including nonlinear and stochastic terms, which describe the collapse of the wave function in space. These spontaneous collapses are “rare” for microscopic systems, hence their quantum properties are left almost unaltered. At the same time, since the collapses add coherently in composite systems, macroscopic spatial superpositions of macro-objects are rapidly suppressed. I will review the main features of collapse models. In particular, I will discuss ideas to connect the collapse of the wave function to gravity: The Diosi-Penrose model, Adler’s model and the Schroedinger-Newton equation. Next, I will present an update of the most promising ways of testing them in interferometric and non-interferometric experiments, showing the current lower and upper bounds on their parameters.",2017-08-23 14:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Angelo Bassi,
942,Geodesic mapping for non-symmetric gravitation theory (NGT) with torsion,"Connections with (skew-symmetric) torsion on a non-symmetric Riemannian    manifold satisfying the Einstein metricity condition (non-symmetric gravitation    theory (NGT) with torsion) are considered.    In the general case of a geodesic mapping $f$ of two NGT manifolds it is    impossible to obtain a generalization of the Weyl projective    curvature tensor. In the paper we study the case when these manifolds have the same torsion in corresponding points.Such a mapping we name ""equitorsion mapping"".    With respect to  curvature tensors we have    obtained quantities, that are generalizations of the Weyl tensor, i.e. they are invariants based on $f$.  All these    quantities are interesting in constructions of new mathematical and    physical structures.",2017-08-28 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,https://me.yahoo.com/a/NjbRTy15qdwcUkUX_tupKsRRNjAALA--#0d66d Zlatanovic,
946,Surrounding matter theory,"In this paper, S.M.T. (Surrounding Matter Theory), an alternative theory to dark matter, is presented. It is based on a modification of Newton’s law. This modification is done by multiplying a Newtonian potential by a given factor, which is varying with local distribution of matter, at the location where the gravitational force is exerted. With this new equation the model emphasizes that a gravitational force is roughly inversely proportional to mass density at the location where this force is applied. After presentation of the model, its dynamic is quickly illustrated by cosmology. Some possible caveats of the model are identified. But the simple mechanism described above suggests the idea of a solution to the following issues: virial theorem mystery, the value of cosmological critical density, the fine tuning issue, and expansion acceleration. A de Sitter Universe is predicted. The predicted time since last scattering is  . This study gives motivation for scientific comparisons with experimental data.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Frederic Lassiaille,
947,Search for the violation of Pauli principle at LNGS - first physics result of VIP2 experiment,"We search for x-rays from abnormal atomic orbit electron transitions that may violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in the VIP-2 experiment at Gran Sasso national laboratory. The candidate events come from a $2p$ electron transits into a $1s$ orbit which is occupied by two electrons. Such event, if exists, will have detectable energy difference from normal $2p-1s$ atomic transition by few hundreds of electron-volts in case it occurs in a copper atom, and the energy difference is expected to be the result of the electromagnetic shielding effect from the additional electron in the ground state.    The experimental setup with the complete detector system was mounted in the underground laboratory in 2015, and we started the physics run without the final passive lead shielding since October 2016.     From two months of data taking, we confirmed the performance of the apparatus that will fulfill the designed goal of the experiment. Moreover preliminary result from the first period of physics run already improved the upper limit set by the previous VIP experiment.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Talk,Poster session,"C Quantum Physics, Quantum Optics and Quantum Information",HEXI SHI,
948,PHENIX spin overview,"The spin program at the relativistic heavy ion collider RHIC set out to understand the contribution of gluon and sea quark spins to the total spin of the nucleon. In the PHENIX experiment gluon spins are being accessed via double longitudinal spin asymmetries of neutral final-state pions as well as other final state particles. Using center-of-mass collision energies from 62 to 510 GeV a clear, non-zero gluon polarization at intermediate x could be established. The analysis of final state particles in more forward rapidities also allows to study and constrain the spin contributions to lower x.    In order to access the sea quark spin contribution the production of real W bosons has been studied. The parity violation of the weak interactino allows to select the helicity of the participating quark-antiquark pair and the charge of the produced W boson selects the flavor. Single longitudinal spin asymmetries from leptonic W decays into electrons at central rapidities and muons at forward rapidities have been measured and indicate an asymmetric, polarized light sea.    Furthermore, large transverse single spin asymmetries once thought to be low energy effects persisted to the highest collision energies. They sparked substantial improvements in the understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon and its dynamics while the complete origin of these effects is still not entirely understood. Recent polarized proton-nucleus collisions allowed PHENIX to extend the asymmetry measurements to nucleii and new surprises, especially for forward neutron asymmetries were found.    This presentation will summarize the current status of the PHENIX spin program and a potential future extension.",2017-08-24 06:15:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,A Particle Physics,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Ralf Seidl,
950,Models of spontaneous wave function collapse: what they are and how they can be tested,"To make quantum theory consistent, models of spontaneous wave function collapse (collapse models) propose to modify the Schrödinger equation by including nonlinear and stochastic terms, which describe the collapse of the wave function in space. These spontaneous collapses are “rare” for microscopic systems, hence their quantum properties are left almost unaltered. At the same time, since these effects add coherently in composite systems, macroscopic spatial superpositions of macro-objects are rapidly suppressed. I will review the main features of collapse models, in a pedagogical way, by presenting the GRW (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber) collapse model. Next, I will present an update of the most promising ways of testing them in interferometric and non-interferometric experiments, showing the current lower and upper bounds on their parameters.",2017-08-22 05:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,C Quantum Optics and Quantum Information,"C Quantum Physics, Quantum Optics and Quantum Information",Angelo Bassi,
951,The physical vacuum in standard theories and in alternative approaches,"We discuss the possible role of the physical vacuum in different approaches to Particle Physics and Cosmology, and suggest new dynamical scenarios involving unconventional vacuum Physics. The internal dynamics of the physical vacuum can be basically independent from that described by standard Quantum Field Theory and with a deeper content. It can play a fundamental role driving the evolution of the Universe and leading the ultimate laws of Particle Physics. Possible preonic structures and pre-Big Bang models are also considered in this respect, as well as a composite structure of standard particle interactions including gravity.     An updated review of these and related problematics is presented, including relevant original patterns. Attention is devoted to the present situation concerning black holes and gravitational waves.",2017-08-29 05:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Mini-Workshop on Latest Results and New Physics in the Higgs Sector,Luis Gonzalez-Mestres,"https://indico.cern.ch/event/559774/contributions/2647709/attachments/1497176/2330102/Cosmological_implications_of_a_preonic_vacuum.pdf, https://indico.cern.ch/event/559774/contributions/2647709/attachments/1497176/2330100/GONZALEZ-MESTRES_Luis_ICNFP2016_lecture.pdf, https://indico.cern.ch/event/559774/contributions/2647709/attachments/1497176/2330103/GONZALEZ-MESTRES_Luis_ICNFP2016_poster2.pdf"
953,"The analogy of equation of rotation in complex plane with the Dirac equation, and its foundation","Quantum mechanics is based or formulated on postulates. The first postulate states that the state of quantum mechanics system is defined by the wave function. The Schrödinger equation has the form of a differential equation describing the evolution process of the function. Dirac equation is derived on the base of that postulate of wave function evolution in addition to Dirac’s proposed linearized Hamiltonian form.     Within the frame of Dirac’s relativistic quantum theory, Hestenes in 1990 refers the complex wave function to a kinematic origin (Zitterbewegung), and Arminjon  argued that Dirac field is a complex vector field.     The present project is not in quantum mechanics. It tries to propose a mathematical model. This model is based on the mathematical foundations of the complex phase factor and the complex vector, those has been proposed by Hestenes and Arminjon. The model is a complex vector in terms of complex phase factor. The project is in two parts. The first tries to find analogy between time differentiation of the complex vector and the position-space Dirac equation . The second tries to find a physical explanation for the complex vector.     In the first part, the equation of time differentiation of the complex vector shows analogy with the Dirac equation form. The two obtained coefficients those corresponding to the Dirac coefficients have similar properties of those of Dirac. These two coefficients are related to the rotation of the point. The second derivative of the complex vector shows analogy with Klein-Gordon equation.     In the second part, the complex vector is considered in trigonometrical form. That led to assume a general real algebraic form for the complex vector, and the complex vector is a special case of the real form. The real trigonometrical form exhibits a real kinematical model. Transformation from real kinematical model to complex form is attributed to partial observation, which is an empirical problem. Sanduk in 2012 proposed the partial observation as an empirical technique for that transformation.",2017-08-25 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Mohammed Sanduk,
954,The nature and origin of Quantum Mechanics,"An updated discussion is presented of the various approaches to the deep nature and ultimate origin of Quantum Mechanics, with particular emphasis on the possible role of space-time beyond standard relativity and of the physical vacuum beyond standard Quantum Field Theory. Uncertainties on the cosmological history of the generation of Quantum Mechanics are also dealt with. Experimental tests and possible modifications of standard quantum mechanics are equally considered.",2017-08-25 11:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Luis Gonzalez-Mestres,"https://indico.cern.ch/event/559774/contributions/2653325/attachments/1497175/2330098/GONZALEZ-MESTRES_Luis_ICNFP2016_lecture.pdf, https://indico.cern.ch/event/559774/contributions/2653325/attachments/1497175/2330099/Quantum_Mechanics_and_the_Spinorial_Space-Time.pdf"
956,PHENIX Measurements of Charm and Bottom Decays,"Heavy flavor quarks are a particularly good tool to probe nuclear collisions at RHIC energies, as they are produced dominantly through the initial parton-parton collision rather than during thermalization. This causes them to experience the full evolution of the collision system. PHENIX has produced several measurements of both bottom and charm quarks through their decays, providing insight to the mass dependent energy loss quarks experience while propagating through the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).  This talk will focus on preliminary results of measurements of bottom and charm quarks through their semileptonic decays at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV including their nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) and measurements of the nuclear modification of B mesons through the B$\rightarrow$J/ψ decay.",2017-08-25 12:15:00+00:00,20 minutes,Talk,B Heavy Ion Physics Session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,Timothy Rinn,
958,Towards the first measurement of matter-antimatter gravitational interaction,"The AEgIS (Antimatter Experiment: gravity, Interferometry, Spectroscopy) is a CERN based experiment with the central aim to measure directly the gravitational acceleration of antihydrogen. Antihydrogen atoms will be produced via charge exchange reactions which will consist of Rydberg-excited positronium atoms sent to cooled antiprotons within an electromagnetic trap. The resulting Rydberg antihydrogen atoms would then be horizontally accelerated by an electric field gradient (Stark effect), they will then pass through a moiré deflectometer. The vertical deflections caused by the Earth gravitational field will test for the first time the Weak Equivalence principle for antimatter. Detection will be undertaken via a position sensitive detector. Around `10^3` antihydrogen atoms are needed for the gravitational measurement to be undertaken.    The present status, current achievements and results will be presented, with special attention to the strategies to produce positronium atoms in different geometries.",2017-08-26 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,"D Cosmology, Astrophysics, Gravity, Mathematical Physics",Craig William Evans,
959,Recent PHENIX results on high-pT light hadron production,"Production of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) has been established in central heavy ion collisions (Au+Au, Cu+Cu) at RHIC energies. Observation of strong suppression of hadron yields at high transverse momentum served as one of the most important evidences in favor of production of a new state of matter in such collisions. Recent RHIC run with asymmetric collision system (Cu+Au) provides the means to systematically study suppression pattern of hadrons in different nuclear overlap geometry needed to improve theoretical description of parton energy loss in QGP.    Non-zero elliptic flow and a hint of suppression of high pT hadrons suggests that mini-QGP can be formed in collisions of light and heavy nuclei characterized by high charged particle multiplicities. To address the question of collective behavior in small systems RHIC provided series of geometry controlled experiments with highly asymmetric systems (p+Al, p+Au, He3+Au).    The recent results from PHENIX experiment at RHIC on charged hadron, pi-zero, eta and phi meson production in asymmetric systems will be presented and discussed.",2017-08-28 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,Wenqing Fan,

961,Low-energy K$^-$ interaction with light nuclei by the AMADEUS collaboration,"The AMADEUS collaboration is aiming to study the K$^-$ hadronic interaction with light nuclei in the low-energy regime with high precision. The main goal is to provide information on the $\bar{\mathrm{K}}$N interaction in nuclear medium, fundamental for the understanding of the non-perturbative QCD in the strangeness sector, with implications going from nuclear physics to astrophysics. Hyperon-nucleon/nuclei (YN) and hyperon-pion (Y$\pi$) correlation studies are performed with the aim to explore the possible existence of deeply bound kaonic states in nuclei and the properties of hyperon resonances in nuclear environment. AMADEUS takes advantage of the DA$\Phi$NE collider, which provides a unique source of monochromatic low-momentum kaons ($p_\mathrm{K}$ ~ 127 MeV/c). As a first step, we explore the hadronic interaction of the negative kaons in the materials of the KLOE detector, which is used as large acceptance and resolution active target, providing a high statistic sample of K$^-$ nuclear absorption on H, $^4$He, $^9$Be and $^{12}$C nuclei.

We give an example of spatially flat bouncing solution that is non-singular and stable throughout the whole evolution. The model is arranged in such a way that the scalar field driving the cosmological evolution initially behaves like full-fledged beyond Horndeski, whereas at late times it becomes a massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity.

It successfully describes the    available experimental data on pion and quarkonia ($\phi$, ${\rm J}/\psi$, $\psi({\rm 2S})$, ${\rm\Upsilon}$ family) production at energies from     $\sqrt{s}=$ 5 GeV to the LHC ones. Simple parametrizations for the $\sqrt{s}$ dependence of the model parameters are provided    allowing predictions for the yields of these particles at new collision energies.",2017-08-26 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Smbat Grigoryan,
966,The Pierre Auger Observatory: latest results and future perspectives,"The Pierre Auger Observatory  is the largest ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray observatory in the world.    The huge amount of high quality data collected since 2004 up to now, with a total exposure approaching to  60.000 km^2 sr yr, led to great improvements in our knowledge of the ultra-energetic cosmic rays.     The suppression of the cosmic-ray flux at highest energies was clearly established. For the first time the proton-proton cross sections was measured at the energy 57 TeV in the center of mass system. On the other hand, measurements of the depth of shower maximum indicate a puzzling trend  in the mass composition of cosmic rays at energy around the ankle up to the highest energy.     The just started upgrade of the Observatory, dubbed AugerPrime, will improve the identification of the mass  of primaries and then will allow to disentangle among models of origin and propagation of cosmic rays.",2017-08-24 10:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,"D Astroparticle, Cosmology,d Gravity, Math Phys",Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Mario Buscemi,
967,One quantum shutter can close two slits simultaneously,"The interference between two paths of a single photon at a double slit is widely considered to be the most paradoxical result of quantum theory. Here is a new interesting question to the phenomenon: can a single shutter simultaneously close two slits by effectively being in a superposition of different locations? Supprisingly, Aharonov and Vaidman have shown that it is indeed possible to construct a quantum shutter that can close two (or more) slits and reflect a probe photon perfectly when its initial and final states are appropriately selected [1]. Here, we demonstrate the protocol proposed by Aharonov and Vaidman using a photonic quantum circuit [2]. As a quantum shutter, we used a shutter photon in a superposition state in modes that control two photonic quantum routers for the nonlinear interaction with a probe photon. The experimental results show that when the shutter photon is found in the appropriate final state, the input probe photon is reflected by the quantum shutter, with a probability exceeding the classical limit. By checking the coherence of the output probe photon, we also verified that the quantum superposition of the probe photon is not destroyed by the shutter.    [1] Aharonov, Y., & Vaidman, L.

968,Transverse momentum spectra and nuclear modification factors of identified charged hadrons in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at √sNN  = 5.02 TeV with ALICE,"The ALICE experiment has measured the production of identified light-flavour hadrons in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV in a wide range of transverse momentum (pT ). The newest ALICE results on pion, kaon and proton transverse momentum spectra, yield ratios and nuclear modification factors will be presented and discussed in comparison to lower energy results and hydrodynamical models. In particular, the production of identified hadrons in most central Pb-Pb collisions relative to pp collisions is found to be strongly suppressed at high transverse momenta (pT > 8 GeV/c) whereas in p-Pb collisions the nuclear modification factors are consistent with unity. This indicates that the strong suppression of high- pT hadrons measured in central Pb-Pb collisions is not due to an initial state effect but instead to the energy loss of partons traversing a hot and dense QCD medium.",2017-08-19 13:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,Maria Vasileiou,

The data collected by DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 have been released, and considering also the former DAMA/NaI experiment, the data of 14 independent annual cycles (total exposure 1.33 ton x yr) - analysed by exploiting the model-independent Dark Matter (DM) annual modulation signature - have given evidence at 9.3&sigma; C.L. for the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo. No systematic or side reaction able to mimic the observed eect has been found or suggested by anyone. Other kinds of investigations have been recently performed and will be introduced here.    At present, after an upgrade of the experiment, DAMA/LIBRA is running in its phase-2 with increased sensitivity. R&D's towards a possible future phase-3 are in progress.

971,Statistical superdegeneracy and quantum foundations,"The foundations of quantum mechanics have always been     closely tied to statistical physics; historically, of     course, the former subject began through wrestling with     unresolved issues in the latter.  This presentation     introduces a new concept, statistical superdegeneracy     (unrelated to magnetism and band structures) that may have     implications for quantum foundations.  As one possible     motivation, consider population inversion (e.g., in     lasers). It is a nonequilibrium phenomenon owing to the     dominance of the Boltzmann factor in determining state     occupancy under thermal equilibrium.  State degeneracy,     while adding detail, is assumed to be of secondary     importance.  In this paper, a new type of degeneracy is     explored, one that increases sufficiently rapidly with energy so as to     dominate the Boltzmann exponential, thereby leading to new     phenomena, like population inversion at thermal     equilibrium as well as stationary quantum currents.  Physical systems that might exhibit this anomalous     degeneracy are proposed, and ramifications for quantum and     statistical foundations are discussed.",2017-08-24 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Daniel Sheehan,

973,"Self-Interacting Dark Matter, Right-Handed Neutrinos and Small-Scale Cosmology ``Crisis''","I discuss tensions between numerical simulations based on $Lambda$CDM cosmology and observations at galactic scales (Small-scale Cosmology ``Crisis'') and then proceed to review ways of alleviating them, including the inclusion of self-interacting dark matter. As a specific model of such dark matter, I discuss minimal extensions of the standard model, involving right handed (Majorana) neutrinos, which however are assumed to be self-interacting via vector potentials in the dark sector. The galactic scale phenomenology of such a model, and ways of resolving the aforementioned issues in small-scale cosmology, are discussed. It is found that consistency with observations regarding galactic halo-core structure in several galaxies, including the Milky Way, requires a mass for the right-handed neutrino dark matter in the O(50) keV range, with a self interaction coupling (at low (keV) energies) about eight orders of magntidude stronger than the weak interaction Fermi coupling in the corresponding range of energies. This mass range of right-handed neutrinos is in a remarkable coincidence with that for the lightest right-handed Majorana neutrino in the so-called nuMSM (neutrino Minimal Standard Model) of Shaposhnikov and collaborators, which, though, is attained by a different reasoning. If time allows, I will also discuss a novel mechanism for generating such a mass, which goes beyond conventional mechanisms for neutrino masses.

974,Counter-intuitive phenomena in quantum mechanics  emerging in matter-wave optical experiments,"Peculiarities of quantum mechanical predictions on a fundamental level are investigated intensively in matter-wave optical setups; in particular, neutron interferometric strategy has been providing almost ideal experimental circumstances for experimental demonstrations of quantum effects. In this device quantum interference between beams spatially separated on a macroscopic scale is put on explicit view. Recently, a new counter-intuitive phenomenon, called quantum Cheshire-cat, is observed in a neutron interferometer experiment. Weak measurement and weak values justify the access of the neutrons’ dynamics in the interferometer. Moreover, another experiment reported full determination of weak-values of neutron’s ½-spin; this experiment is further applied to demonstrate quantum Pigeonhole effect and quantum contextual. In my talk, I am going to give an overview of neutron interferometry for investigation of quantum paradoxes.",2017-08-25 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Yuji Hasegawa,
976,Sub-leading flow modes in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV from HYDJET++ model,"Recent LHC results on the appearance of sub-leading flow modes in PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV, related to initial-state fluctuations, are analyzed and interpreted within the HYDJET++ model. Using the newly introduced Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method applied to two-particle azimuthal correlations extracted from the model calculations, the leading and the sub-leading flow modes are studied as a function of the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) over a wide centrality range. The leading modes of the elliptic ($v^{(1)}_{2}$) and triangular ($v^{(1)}_{3}$) flow calculated within the HYDJET++ model reproduce rather well the $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ coefficients experimentally measured using the two-particle correlations. Within the $p_{T} \le $ 3 GeV/c range where hydrodynamics dominates, the sub-leading flow effects are greatest at the highest $p_{T}$ of around 3 GeV/c. The sub-leading elliptic flow mode ($v^{(2)}_{2}$), which corresponds to $n = 2$ harmonic, has a small non-zero value and slowly increases from central to peripheral collisions, while the sub-leading triangular flow mode ($v^{(2)}_{3}$), which corresponds to $n = 3$ harmonic, is even smaller and does not depend on centrality. For $n = $ 2, the relative magnitude of the effect measured with respect to the leading flow mode shows a shallow minimum for semi-central collisions and increases for very central and for peripheral collisions. For $n = $ 3 case, there is no centrality dependence. The sub-leading flow mode results obtained from the HYDJET++ model are in a rather good agreement with the experimental measurements of the CMS Collaboration.",2017-08-23 13:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Jovan Milosevic,

This talk describes the steps involved in deriving the jet energy scale (JES) and presents the results. Calibrations and their uncertainties are shown using the full 2015 + 2016 datasets. The study of jet substructure has also become increasingly more prevalent throughout a wide array of searches and measurements. We also report on the latest results from ATLAS for the reconstruction and tagging of large-R jets as well as the calibration and determination of the uncertainties associated with these techniques.",2017-08-23 13:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,ATLAS,
986,Electron and Photon ID,"Photon and electron identifications are a crucial input to many ATLAS physics analysis.    The identification of prompt photons and the rejection of background coming mostly from photons from hadron decays relies on the high granularity of the ATLAS calorimeter.    The electron identification used in ATLAS for run 2 is based on a likelihood discrimination to separate    isolated electron candidates from candidates originating from photon conversions, hadron misidentification    and heavy flavor decays. In addition, isolation variables are used as further handles to separate    signal and background. Several methods are used to measure with data the efficiency of the photon identification requirements, to cover a broad energy spectrum. At low energy, photons from radiative Z decays are used. In the medium energy range, similarities between electrons and photon showers are exploited using Z->ee decays. At high energy, inclusive photon samples are used. The measurement of the efficiencies of the electron identification and isolation    cuts are performed with the data using tag and probe techniques with large statistics sample of Z->ee    and J/psi->ee decays.  These measurements performed with pp collisions data at sqrt(s)=13 TeV in 2016 (2015)    corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 33.9 (3.1)fb-1 of sqrt(s)=13 TeV pp  are presented.",2017-08-19 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,ATLAS,
987,Tracking and Vertexing with the ATLAS Inner Detector in the LHC Run2 and Beyond,"Run-2 of the LHC has provided new challenges to track and vertex reconstruction with higher centre-of-mass energies and luminosity leading to increasingly high-multiplicity environments, boosted, and highly-collimated physics objects. To achieve this goal, ATLAS is equipped with the Inner Detector tracking system built using different technologies, silicon planar sensors (pixel and micro-strip) and gaseous drift- tubes, all embedded in a 2T solenoidal magnetic field.  In addition, the Insertable B-layer (IBL) is a fourth pixel layer, which was inserted at the centre of ATLAS during the first long shutdown of the LHC. An overview of the use of each of these subdetectors in track and vertex reconstruction, as well as the algorithmic approaches taken to the specific tasks of pattern recognition and track fitting, is given. The performance of the Inner Detector tracking and vertexing will be summarised. These include a factor of three reduction in the reconstruction time, optimisation for the expected conditions, novel techniques to enhance the performance in dense jet cores, time-dependent alignment of sub-detectors and special reconstruction of charged particle produced at large distance from interaction points. Moreover, data-driven methods to evaluate vertex resolution, fake rates, track reconstruction inefficiencies in dense environments, and track parameter resolution and biases will be shown. Luminosity increases in 2017 and beyond will also provide challenges for the detector systems and offline reconstruction, and strategies for mitigating the effects of increasing occupancy will be discussed. Finally, the upgraded 'ITk' tracking detector for operation at the High-Luminosity LHC will be presented. The tracking performance of the all-silicon tracker, which includes an increased tracking acceptance up to |Î·|<4.0, under expected HL-LHC conditions with up to 200 interactions per bunch crossing will be shown. Ongoing optimisation of the track reconstruction and future approaches that may improve the physics and/or technical performance of the ATLAS track reconstruction for HL-LHC are considered.",2017-08-28 09:40:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,ATLAS,

In this talk, we present the first measurement of the W boson mass, based on the 7 TeV data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb-1. With these samples the detector and physics modelling has been studied in great detail, leading to an overall uncertainty of 19 MeV.  The ATLAS collaboration also performed a new precise triple differential cross-section measurement as a function of M(ll), dilepton rapidity and cos?* defined in the Collins-Soper frame. This measurement provides sensitivity to the PDFs and the Z forward-backward asymmetry, AFB, which is derived and will be presented. This builds the foundation for a possible future extraction of the weak-mixing angle.    The production of jets in association with vector bosons is an important process to study perturbative QCD in a multi-scale environment. The ATLAS collaboration has performed new measurements of vector boson + jets cross sections, differential in several kinematic variables, in proton-proton collision data taken at center-of-mass energies of 8 TeV and 13 TeV, which will be presented. The measurements are compared to state-of-the art theory predictions. They are sensitive to higher-order pQCD effects, probe  flavour and mass schemes  and can be used to constrain the proton structure. In addition, we present a new measurement of the splitting scales of the kt jet-clustering algorithm for final states containing a Z-boson candidate at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV.",2017-08-23 14:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,ATLAS,
989,Recent Tests of the Standard Model with Multi boson final states at the ATLAS Detector,"Measurements of the cross sections of the production of two and three electroweak gauge bosons at the LHC constitute stringent tests of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and provide a model-independent means  to search for new physics at the TeV scale.    The ATLAS collaboration has performed new measurements of integrated and differential cross sections of the production of heavy di-boson pairs in fully-leptonic and semi-leptonic final states at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV.   We present in particular new measurements of WW, WZ and Z+photon cross sections in semi-leptonic or hadronic decays using standard or boosted technologies and new measurements of the inclusive and differential ZZ cross section at 13 TeV  in various decay modes.    In addition, the ATLAS collaboration has recently searched for the production of three W bosons or of a W boson and a photon together with a Z or W boson at a center of mass energy of 8 TeV.  Moreover, the electroweak production in vector boson fusion of single W and Z bosons with two jets at high invariant mass at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV are studied in different phase space regions. All results are compared to state-of-the art theory predictions and have  been used to constrain anomalous quartic gauge couplings.",2017-08-28 07:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,Mini-Workshop on Latest Results and New Physics in the Higgs Sector,ATLAS,
990,Probing QCD with Photons and Jets at the ATLAS Detector,"The production of jets and prompt isolated photons at hadron colliders provides a stringent test of perturbative QCD at the highest energies. The process can also be used to probe the proton structure.    The ATLAS collaboration has recently measured the inclusive and differential jet and dijet production cross section in data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and 13 TeV. We also present new measurements of transverse energy-energy correlations (TEEC) and their associated asymmetries (ATEEC) in multi-jet events at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data is unfolded to the particle level and is used to extract the strong coupling constant and test the renormalization group equations. The Strong coupling constant is also extracted from a measurement of the diet azimuthal decorrelation.    We will also present precise measurements of the inclusive production of isolated prompt photons at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, differential in both rapidity and the photon transverse momentum. This will be complemented by measurements of isolated photon pair and tri-photon production 8 TeV.  The production of prompt photons in association with jets combines jet and photon final states and provides an additional testing ground for perturbative QCD with a hard colourless probe less affected by hadronisation effects than jet production also. The ATLAS collaboration has studied the dynamics of isolated-photon plus jet production and of the isolated photon+heavy flavour final states in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV and 13 TeV, which will be presented and discussed.    All results have been compared with state-of-the-art theory predictions at NLO and NNLO in pQCD, interfaced with different parton distribution functions and can be used to constrain the proton structure.",2017-08-28 09:15:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,ATLAS,
991,"Measurements of low energy observables, elastic pp interactions and exclusive production in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS Detector","Low energy phenomena have been studied in detail at the LHC, providing important input for improving models of non-perturbative QCD effects. The ATLAS collaboration has performed several new measurements in this sector, which will be discussed. In particular, we present studies on the correlated hadron production, as they are an important source for information on the early stages of hadron formation and allow to study coherent particle production. The results are compared to the predictions of a helical QCD string fragmenting model.    In the absence of forward proton tagging, exclusive processes can be distinguished in the central part of the ATLAS detector exploiting the absence of charged particles reconstructed in the inner tracking detector.  We present a first measurement of the exclusive two-photon production of muon pairs  in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The results show significant deviations from the pure QED prediction, which can be explained by proton-proton rescattering effects. We also show a first measurement of the exclusive production of pions, using the ALFA detector to tag forward protons and, if available, a first study of diffractive jet production using the new AFP detector.",2017-08-26 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,ATLAS,
992,Top quark production cross-section measurements,"Measurements of the inclusive and differential cross-sections for top-quark pair and single top production cross sections in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider are presented at center-of-mass energies of 8 TeV and 13 TeV. The inclusive measurements reach high precision and are compared to the best available theoretical calculations. These measurements, including results using boosted tops, probe our understanding of top-pair production in the TeV regime. The results are compared to Monte Carlo generators implementing LO and NLO matrix elements matched with parton showers and NLO QCD calculations. For the t-channel single top measurement, the single top-quark and anti-top-quark total production cross-sections, their ratio, as well as differential cross sections are also presented. A measurement of the production cross-section of a single top quark in association with a W boson, the second largest single-top production mode, is also presented. Finally, measurements of    the properties of the Wtb vertex allow to set limits on anomalous couplings.

993,Top quark properties and mass measurements with the ATLAS detector,"The top quark is unique among the known quarks in that it decays before it has an opportunity to form hadronic bound states. This makes measurements of its properties particularly interesting as one can access directly the properties of a bare quark. The latest measurements of these properties with the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. Measurements of top quark spin observables in top-antitop events, each sensitive to a different coefficient of the spin density matrix, are presented and compared to the Standard Model predictions. The helicity of the W boson from the top decays and the production angles of the top quark are further discussed. Limits on the rate of flavour changing neutral currents in the production or decay of the top quark are reported. The production of top-quark pairs in association with W and Z bosons is also presented. The measurement probes the coupling between the top quark and the Z boson. The cross-section measurement of photons produced in association with top-quark pairs is also discussed. These process are all compared to the best available theoretical calculations.

The determination of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a pair of top quarks is of particular importance as the ttH Yukawa coupling is large, and thus a probe for physics beyond the Standard Model.

1011,Superheavy Nuclei to Hypernuclei: A Tribute to Walter Greiner,"In nuclear physics, superheavy and hypernuclei are two of the most important fields of research. The prediction of islands of superheavy elements (Z = 114, N = 184, 196 and Z = 164, N = 318) in late sixties by the Frankfurt school played a key role in extending the periodic table of elements up to atomic number 118. Similarly, the demonstration that nuclear matter can be compressed 510 times of its original volume by nuclear shock waves, produced during heavy ion collision, led to the production of single- and double-lambda hypernuclei, as well as anti-matter nuclei. Recent observation of antihypertriton—comprising an antiproton, an antineutron, and an antilambda hyperon, by the STAR collaboration has now made it possible to envision a 3-dimensional nuclear chart of hypernuclei. My own interest in superheavy and hypernuclei was shaped from my first meeting with Walter Greiner at the International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear clusters held at Santorini, Greece in 1993. I will present a brief summary of these exciting developments, including some of our own work.

We introduce additional one top-like quark, two bottom-like quarks, three right handed neutrinos and two charged leptons in order to have an anomaly free theory. We also consider additional three right handed neutrinos which are  singlets respect to the gauge symmetry of the model to implement see saw mechanism and give masses to the light neutrinos according to the neutrino oscillation phenomenology. In the context of this horizontal gauge symmetry we find mass ansatz for leptons and quarks. In  particular from the analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments we get the allow region for the Yukawa couplings for the charged and neutral lepton sectors  according with the mass squared differences  and mixing angles for the two neutrino hierarchy schemes, normal and inverted.",2017-08-23 15:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Roberto Martinez,
1014,Molecular Clouds as the Origin of the Gamma-Ray GeV excess,"The  ""GeV-excess"" of the diffuse gamma-rays, as observed by the Fermi-LAT satellite, is studied with a spectral template fit based on  energy spectra   for each possible process of gamma-ray emission.  If all physical processes are included, one should be able to describe the whole gamma-ray sky in all regions, including the Galactic center, the Fermi Bubbles and the ""GeV-excess"". In addition to the ""standard"" physical processes for gamma-ray production from $\pi_0$ decays produced by diffused cosmic rays, inverse Compton scattering and Bremsstrahlung we find  clear evidence for two additional processes: $\pi_0$ production in sources during acceleration and $\pi_0$ production in molecular clouds. The first one is characterized by nuclear cosmic rays with the hard $1/E^{2.1}$ spectrum, expected from diffusive shock wave acceleration. The second one is characterized by  nuclear cosmic rays inside molecular clouds  with a sharp cutoff below 14 GV, due to a process analogous to the geomagnetic cutoff, which is most clearly observed in the dense Central Molecular Zone encircling the Galactic center in the Galactic disk. Such a suppression of low energy nuclei leads to a shift in the maximum of the gamma-ray spectrum to higher energies, the hall-mark of the ""GeV-excess"". To see if this excess can indeed be explained by the propagation inside molecular clouds, one needs to check in addition the spatial distribution. Fortunately, molecular clouds can be traced by the rotation lines of the CO molecule. Furthermore, the nuclear cosmic rays can be traced by the 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line from radioactive $^{26}$Al decays, which is synthesized in sources.     The similar morphology between sources, high-energy tail in gamma-ray spectra, molecular clouds and the ""GeV-excess"" establishes the two new processes discussed above and provides evidence that the ""GeV-excess"" is produced inside molecular clouds, thus excluding the interpretation of a dark matter annihilation signal. This erroneous interpretation is easily explained by the fact that the    column density of molecular clouds resembles the spatial distribution of an annihilation signal, at least if the field-of-view is limited to a cone of less than 20$^\circ$ around  the Galactic center, while the shift of the maximum of the gamma-ray  energy spectrum inside molecular clouds, most likely originating from a magnetic cutoff and energy losses, resembles the spectral shape of a dark matter annihilation signal of  60 GeV dark matter particles.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Wim De Boer,
1015,Perspectives on Detection of  supersymmetric Dark Matter,"In the next-to minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is a candidate for the dark matter (DM) in the universe. It is a mixture from the various gauginos and Higgsinos and can be bino-, Higgsino- or singlino-dominated. These different scenarios are discussed in detail and compared with the sensitivity of future direct DM search experiments, where we use an efficient sampling technique of the parameter space.     The results will be compared with the MSSM.     We find that LSPs with a significant amount of Higgsino and bino admixture will have cross sections in reach of future direct DM experiments, so the background from coherent neutrino scattering is not yet limiting the sensitivity.    Both, the spin-dependent (SD) and spin-independent (SI) searches are important, depending on the dominant admixture.     If the predicted relic density is too low, additional dark matter candidates are needed, in which case the LSP direct dark matter searches loose sensitivity of the reduced LSP density. This is taken into account for expected sensitivity.    The most striking result is that the singlino-like LSP has regions of parameter space with cross sections below the ""neutrino floor"", both for SD and SI interactions. In this region the background from coherent neutrino scattering is expected to be too high, in which case the NMSSM will evade discovery via direct detection experiments.

1019,Modification of Material Surface by Plasma,"Surface modification is an act for modifying the surface of materials by changing physical, chemical or biological characteristics different from ones previously. These modifications are usually made to solid materials. The modification can be done by different methods for altering characteristics of the surface such as roughness, hydrophilicity, surface charge, surface energy, biocompatibility and reactivity.  It is possible either to improve wettability and therefore coating adhesion or to decrease wettability in order to provide an extra protection by surface treatment. The Improvement of material surface wettability can improve bonding properties; it can also enhance physical and mechanical properties of material composites. In this study, low-pressure plasma technique was carried out to modify the surface of material. The effects of different treatment parameters such as type of gas, percentage of gas and aging time on wettability were investigated. The treatment effect was evaluated by measuring contact angles of liquids and calculating the free surface energy. The effect of plasma treatment on morphology of surfaces was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,,marjan abbasipour,

There are only a few experimental hints towards new physics and deviation from standard model and one such example is top quark‘s asymmetry which is an interesting observable related to top quark that can lead us to physics beyond Standard Model. This asymmetry refers to the diﬀerence in number of top quark produced in the forward direction and backward direction or the diﬀerence in the number of top anti-top pair produced, hence it may be a good way to look for a new physics. We consider one phenomenological model containing an extra neutral boson to characterize the new physics that may be responsible for this deviation. We estimate the amount of this asymmetry in this model. this model capture some generic eﬀects of a large number of theories such as Technicolor and Little Higgs Mode.",2017-08-29 08:50:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Shabana Nisar,

We also make a bridge to the lattice version of the linear covariant gauge, in particular to suitably define the ghost propagator.    Finally, we also show, for the 1st time to our knowledge, how to derive the non-Abelian Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations, which implement a gauge variation at the level of quantum correlation functions.

The extended carrier of radial energies contains chaotic motions of material densities associated to the rest mass-energy or internal relativistic heat. Chaotic (internal) and ordered (translation) kinetic energies tend to equal values under the free gravitational fall. This universal tendency of any falling body to equipartition of its relativistic kinetic energies can shed a new light on the cyclic geodetic motion and on the periodic evolution of multi-body systems.     	Thermal radiation/absorption can vary geodesic paths of free bodies. Einstein’s relativistic dynamics of full energies incorporates variable heat of real thermodynamic bodies even at low speeds. The Newton model of masses without temperature cannot be a true nonrelativistic limit for SR/GR references. We explain quantitatively why “Einstein's theory can be accepted only with the recognition that Newton's was wrong.” (S. Kuhn.

Riabov for the ALICE Collaboration    Hadronic resonances are very useful in exploring various aspects of heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, yields of resonances measured via hadronic decay channels can be affected by particle rescattering and regeneration in the hadronic gas phase. The momentum dependence of rescattering and regeneration cross sections may also modify the observed momentum distributions of the reconstructed resonances. Resonances as hadrons with different masses and quark composition also contribute to the systematic study of in-medium parton energy loss at high transverse momentum and help to distinguish among different mechanisms responsible for particle production at intermediate momentum.    In this talk we present the most recent ALICE results on $\rho(770)^{0}$, $K*(892)^{0}$, $\phi(1020)$, $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$$\Lambda(1520)$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ production in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at various collision energies including results from the latest Pb-Pb run at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The comprehensive set of resonance measurements is used to study strangeness production, the role of re-scattering and regeneration in the hadronic phase as well as particle production at intermediate and high transverse momentum.

1031,Probing resonance matter with HADES,"In heavy-ion collisions at few GeV per nucleon energy regime, QCD matter with densities several times larger than the normal nuclear matter density and temperatures of about 80 MeV is created. At such extreme conditions the fundamental properties of the hadrons are expected to be modified. The properties of produced QCD matter can be extracted directly from its emissivity in electromagnetic sector or from the production of the rare (multi-) strange particles.    The High Acceptance DiElecton Spectrometer (HADES), installed at heavy-ion synchrotron SIS18 at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung (Germany), is currently the only experiment studying properties of strongly interacting matter in a few A GeV energy regime. It studies dielectron and hadron production in heavy-ion collisions, as well as in proton- and pion-induced reactions in the energy range of 1 − 4 GeV. HADES is a fixed-target experiment with large angular acceptance and high rate capabilities.    In this contribution main emphasis will be put on most recent results on strangeness and dielectron production in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.42 GeV.

1032,Flavourful roads to New Physics,"The absence of any direct signals of new particles or force carriers at the LHC forces us to contemplate the real possibility of what was called the nightmare scenario a decade ago : the LHC has found the Higgs, but the physics which lies beyond the Standard Model (BSM) also lies beyond its energy reach. A growing number of flavour physics anomalies, however, may not only be giving us a glimpse of BSM particles, but can also help us to understand their properties long before any direct detection is possible. In this talk I will review the current flavour physics anomalies and their possible interpretations, before describing how the upgrades of the LHCb detector will drive a precise understanding of these anomalies and any BSM physics which may be causing them. In particular, I will discuss the physics case for the recently proposed Phase II upgrade of the LHCb detector, which aims to collect 300fb-1 of data at an instantaneous luminosity of 2e34cm-2s-1 from 2031 onwards. Key to this physics case will be extending the full real-time analysis of the collected data, pioneered by LHCb since 2015, to the 1000 times greater data rate of the Phase II upgrade, and I will discuss this and the other technical challenges which will have to be overcome in order to fully understand what flavour is telling us about possible BSM physics and where it may be found.",2017-08-21 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,A Particle Physics,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Vladimir Gligorov,
1033,A-dependence of $\Lambda\Lambda$-bond and charge symmetry energies,"The $\Lambda\Lambda$ bond energies ($\Delta B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$) of double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei provide a measure of the nature of the in-medium strength of the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction. Likewise, the charge symmetry breaking in mirror nuclei with $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda\Lambda$ is expected to shed light on $\Lambda$N and $\Lambda\Lambda$N interactions. The $\Lambda\Lambda$-separation energy ($B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$) from a double-$\Lambda$  nucleus exceeds twice the value of the $\Lambda$-separation energy ($B_{\Lambda}$)  of a single-$\Lambda$  nucleus and this excess is known as the bond energy given by,     $\Delta B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$=$B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$ ($^A_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Z)- 2$B_{\Lambda}$ ($^{A-1}_{\Lambda}$Z),    where A is the mass number with the hyperon number included. A generalized mass formula, constructed earlier with broken SU3 symmetry, is employed to calculate the separation energies from light to heavy nuclei. The newly available experimental data on $\Lambda\Lambda$ -separation energy of several double-$\Lambda$  nuclei, and some single-$\Lambda$  nuclei put stringent constraint on this formula leading to a modification of one of its parameters. The $B_{\Lambda}$ , $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$ and $\Delta B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$ values calculated with this revised mass formula are in good agreement with the experimental data. Results are also compared with the recent predictions from the quark mean-field model (QMF) and the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach. The mass formula enables prediction of the bond energy and symmetry energy for a wide range of nuclei for which experimental $\Lambda$- and $\Lambda\Lambda$-separation energy values are not yet available.

1035,Measurements of D-meson production in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with the ALICE detector at the LHC,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are a powerful tool to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), the hot and dense medium formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are produced in hard partonic scattering processes in the initial stages of the collision. Therefore, they experience the whole system evolution interacting with the medium constituents. The measurement of heavy-flavour production can give us different information depending on the type of collision. In p-Pb collisions, it makes it possible to study cold nuclear matter effects, such as shadowing, $k_{\rm T}$ broadening and initial-state energy loss, as well as possible geometrical and collective effects in high-multiplicity events. In Pb-Pb collisions, it allows us to test parton energy-loss models and to investigate the participation of heavy quarks in the collective expansion of the system.          In ALICE, open charm production is measured through the full reconstruction of D-meson hadronic decays at mid-rapidity.     In this talk, the ALICE results on the production of prompt D mesons in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions will be presented, focusing on the recent results from LHC Run II data.     The main physical observables measured are: the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$), which compares the D-meson yields in p-Pb (Pb-Pb) collisions to the binary scaled D-meson yields in pp collisions, and the elliptic flow ($v_2$), the second Fourier coefficient of the D-meson azimuthal distribution. We will report the D-meson cross section and nuclear modification factor in p-Pb collisions as a function of the event multiplicity. In addition, the $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ in different Pb-Pb collision centralities will be discussed. The results will be also compared with theoretical predictions.",2017-08-19 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,Cristina Bedda,

A numerical estimate of the field strength experienced by ϒ mesons embedded in the expanding QGP and its consequence on the ϒ dissociation is made. The electromagnetic field effects prove to be negligible compared to the established strong-interaction suppression mechanisms.

Perspective for future investigations within new FAIR project, results of comparison between models and available data and the corresponding R&D effort will be described as well. Particulary the data obtained with HADES spectrometer will be discussed in detail. The HADES spectrometer installed at GSI Darmstadt is a second generation experiment designed to measure e+e- pairs (dielectrons) as well as charge hadrons in the SIS∕BEVALAC energy regime. The main goal of the experiment is to learn about in-medium hadron properties. For this purpose a dedicated programme focusing on systematic investigation of dielectron and charge hadrons production in nucleon-nucleon, proton-nucleus and heavy ion reactions is on-going. A comparison of the nucleon-nucleon data to the one obtained in more complex systems allows for isolation of true in-medium effects. Recently, these investigation were complemented by study of secondary negative pion beam interactions with proton as well as with different nuclei. Furthermore, thank to excellent particle identification capabilities of the detector, investigations have also been extended to strangeness production, which at these energies is confined to a high density zone of the collision. The obtained data call for further systematic investigations at higher baryonic densities, where no dielectron and very limited data on strangeness exist. For this reason, experiments with HADES and new CBM spectrometer on the coming FAIR facility are under preparation. The existing HADES spectrometer will be complemented by an electromagnetic calorimeter based on lead-glass modules. The calorimeter will enable to get in addition data on production of the π0 and η mesons via their two-photon decay. No respective data are presently available for the energy range 4--40 AGeV, with the consequence that such upgrade is needed to avoid interpretation of future dielectron data based solely on theoretical models.",2017-08-24 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Andrej Kugler,

1043,Ultrafast Optical Homodyne - Measuring the Fundamental Variables of Quantum Optics $10^5$ Times Faster,"Homodyne measurement is a corner-stone of quantum optics. It measures the fundamental variables of quantum electrodynamics - the quadratures of light, which represent the cosine-wave and sine-wave components of an optical field. The quadratures constitute the quantum optical analog of position and momentum in mechanics and obey quantum uncertainty, indicating the inherent inability to measure both simultaneously. The homodyne process, which extracts a chosen quadrature amplitude by correlating the optical field against an external quadrature reference (local-oscillator, LO), forms the backbone of coherent detection in physics and engineering, and plays a central role in quantum information processing. Homodyne can reveal non-classical phenomena, such as squeezing of the quadrature uncertainty; It is used in tomography to fully characterize quantum states of light; Homodyne detection can generate non-classical states, provide local measurements for teleportation and serve as a major detector for quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum computing. Yet, standard homodyne suffers from a severe bandwidth limitation. While the bandwidth of optical states can easily span many THz, standard homodyne detection is inherently limited to the electrically accessible, MHz to GHz range, leaving a dramatic gap between the relevant optical phenomena and the measurement capability. This gap impedes effective utilization of the huge bandwidth resource of optical states and the potential enhancement of the information throughput \emph{by several orders of magnitude} with parallel processing in quantum computation, QKD and other applications of quantum squeezed light. Here we demonstrate a fully parallel optical homodyne measurement across an arbitrary optical bandwidth, effectively lifting the bandwidth limitation completely. Using optical parametric amplification, which amplifies one quadrature while attenuating the other, we measure two-mode quadrature squeezing of $1.5$dB below the vacuum level simultaneously across a bandwidth of $55$THz using a single LO - the pump. This broadband parametric homodyne measurement opens a wide window for parallel processing of quantum information.",2017-08-25 09:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Avi Pe'er,
1045,Atomic physics with highly-charged heavy ions at GSI/FAIR,"Highly charged ions (HCI) combine extremely strong electromagnetic fields and a simple electronic structure, which makes them ideal testing grounds for fundamental theories such as quantum mechanics, relativity and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the domain of strongest electromagnetic fields available for experimental investigation. In the heaviest one- and few-electron ions, such as hydrogen-like uranium, the field strength exposed on the electron in the ground-state is already very close to the Schwinger limit. Therefore, the structure (and also the dynamics) of highly-charged ions is significantly influenced by the effects of the quantum vacuum.     The new international accelerator Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) which is currently under construction in Darmstadt, offers a wide range of exciting new opportunities in the field of atomic physics and related fields.  These include (among others); cooled and stored heavy-ion beams of excellent quality and intensity, with a very broad energy range; from relativistic down to virtually at rest.     In this presentation, an overview of the program of the Stored Particle Atomic Research Collaboration (SPARC) at the FAIR facility will be given. Particular emphasis will be on precision experiments with highly-charged heavy ions devoted to stringent tests of Quantum Electrodynamics in extreme electromagnetic fields as well as to the experimental program aimed to study low-energy (near-)symmetric ion-atom/ion collisions in storage rings at GSI and FAIR.

1046,Insecurity of detector-device-independent quantum key distribution,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) [1] is a technique that allows distribution of a secret random bit string between two separated parties (Alice and Bob). In theory, QKD provides information-theoretic security based on the laws of quantum physics. In practice, however, it does not, as standard QKD realizations cannot typically fulfill the demands imposed by the theory. As a result, any unaccounted device imperfection might constitute a side-channel which could be used by an eavesdropper (Eve) to extract the secret key without being detected. To bridge this gap, various approaches have been proposed, with measurement-device-independent QKD (mdiQKD) [2] probably being the most promising one in terms of feasibility and performance. Compared to standard prepare-and-measure QKD schemes [1], its security is based on post-selected entanglement. This allows to remove all detector side-channels from QKD implementations. Also, its practicality has been already confirmed both in laboratories and via field trials [3, 4]. However, one drawback of mdiQKD is that it requires high-visibility two-photon interference between independent sources, which makes its implementation more demanding than that of standard prepare-and-measure QKD schemes. Another limitation is its security proofs require larger post-processing data block sizes than those of standard QKD.    To overcome these limitations, a novel approach, so-called detector-device-independent QKD (ddiQKD), has been introduced recently [5–8]. It avoids the problem of interfering photons from independent light sources by using the concept of a single-photon Bell state measurement (BSM) [9]. As a result, it achieves the robust security of MDI-QKD, and at the same time provides the ease of implementation like standard prepare-and-measure QKD schemes. Also, its post-processing data block sizes are expected to be similar to those of standard prepare-and-measure QKD schemes [10]. To summarize, DDI-QKD was assumed to become the 'holy grail' of quantum key distribution protocols.    In this talk, I will show that, although it is widely assumed that DDI-QKD is robust to detector side-channels, it is in practice not true. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we show that, in contrast to mdiQKD, the security of ddiQKD cannot be based on post-selected entanglement alone, as initially thought in [5–8]. Hence, its security is not as robust as MDI-QKD. Second, we show that DDI-QKD is actually insecure against detector side-channel attacks by presenting various eavesdropping strategies that can fully compromise the security of the system.

1047,Low Momentum Direct Photon Measurement,"Direct photons have long been considered as golden probes to study the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). They do not interact strongly with the medium and are produced at all stages of the collision, hence carrying information of the entire evolution of the system to the detectors. The PHENIX experiment discovered a large excess of low $p_{T}$ photons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV compared to reference p+p collisions, which has been interpreted as thermal radiation from the QGP and hadron-gas medium. At the same time, the excess photons show a large elliptic and triangular    flow. These results are challenging for the current theoretical models to describe simultaneously, because on one hand the large yield suggests early stage emissions when the temperature is high, on the other hand the large anisotropy is expected to be formed only at later stages of the collision when the system has cooled off and the thermal photon production rate is expected to be smaller.    Using a variety of high statistics datasets across different collision systems and energies in PHENIX, simultaneous analyses of yields and azimuthal asymmetries of direct photons with higher precision are performed to provide more constraints to the theoretical calculations. In this talk, we will present recent results on low $p_{T}$ direct photons measured via their external conversions to electron-positron pairs, including new results from Au+Au at lower beam energies of 39 and 62.4 GeV, as well as Cu+Cu at 200GeV.",2017-08-28 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,Wenqing Fan,

1050,Heavy sterile neutrino with large mixing angle does not contradict cosmology,"We study a model of keV-scale sterile neutrino with      relatively large mixing with the Standard Model sector.  Usual      considerations predict active generation of such particles in the      Early Universe, which leads to constraints from the total Dark      Matter density and absence of X-ray signal from sterile neutrino      decay.  These bounds together may deem any attempt of creation of      the keV scale sterile neutrino in the laboratory unfeasible.  We      argue that for models with a hidden sector coupled to the sterile      neutrino these bounds can be evaded, opening new perspectives for      the experimental studies at neutrino facilities such as Troitsk $\nu$-mass and KATRINE. We estimate the generation of sterile neutrinos in      scenarios with the hidden sector dynamics keeping the sterile      neutrinos either massless or superheavy in the early Universe; in      both cases the generation by oscillations from active neutrinos in      plasma is suppressed.",2017-08-22 10:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Anton Chudaykin,

1053,GERDA: first background free search for neutrinoless double beta decay,GERDA (GERmanium Detector Array) experiment is designed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay with semiconductor detectors made from germanium enriched in $^{76}$Ge. In GERDA for the first time ever detectors are directly immersed in liquid argon which works as a cooling medium and at the same time as an additional shield against external radioactivity. There are two phases of the GERDA experiment.    Phase I has employed coaxial detectors made from $^{76}$Ge (total mass ~ 18 kg) adopted for liquid argon operations and has successfully finished in May 2013 after reaching the exposure of 20 kg yr. The background index in the region of interest was 0.01 counts/(keV kg yr). The half-life limit for $0\nu\beta\beta$  decay > 2.1 × 10$^{25}$ years has been set (90% C.L.).    In the ongoing GERDA Phase II (started in December 2015) we have the possibility to detect scintillation light in liquid argon surrounding the detectors. Thus argon acts as active veto. In Phase II together with coaxial diodes about 20 kg of novel detectors (so-called BEGe) with enhanced pulse shape discrimination capability are being used to double the target mass. All this has helped to reach the unprecedented background index of 0.001 counts / (keV kg yr). No background event should be left in the energy region where the $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal is expected until the end of data taking in 2019. Thereby GERDA is the first “background-free” experiment in the field. After the first five months of data taking (about 10 kg yr) no $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays have been observed and a half-life limit has been improved to ${T^{0\nu}_{1/2}}$ > 5.3 × 10$^{25}$ yr (90% C.L.). At the time of the Conference a total Phase II exposure of about 40 kg yr is planned to be available.

Forward proton tagging in CMS-TOTEM and Atlas Forward Physics spectrometers allows us to search for anomalous couplings with an unprecedented sensitivity.

It was recently realized that event-by-event initial geometry fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions lead to a new type of correlation between different order anisotropic flow, which has unique sensitivity to initial conditions and shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\eta/s$. In this talk, I discuss the correlation strength between various anisotropic flow harmonics, named (normalized-)symmetric cumulants, in both transport and hydrodynamic model calculations. In addition, the correlations between different order flow symmetry plane will be presented. The results can be naturally understood with recent development of non-linear hydrodynamic response of the created hot and dense matter to initial anisotropy coefficients. A detailed comparison of model calculations and recent experimental measurement, is also presented. Last but not least, I will show how to improve the current development of global Bayesian analysis on constraining the initial conditions and the extraction of the properties of the created QGP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.",2017-08-25 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Joined Session of Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC and Mini-workshop:Correlations and Fluctuations in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,,You Zhou,

Here we consider entanglement of non-local degrees of freedom emerging from topological properties of many-body systems. Specifically, we consider a minimal complexity setup consisting of 6 Majorana bound states. We find that any allowed state in the degenerate Majorana space is non-locally entangled.

We use a near-quantum-limited detector to experimentally track individual quantum trajectories of a driven qubit formed by the hybridization of a waveguide cavity and a transmon circuit. For each measured quantum coherent trajectory, we separately identify energy changes of the qubit as heat and work, and verify the first law of thermodynamics for an open quantum system. We further employ a novel quantum feedback loop to compensate for the exchanged heat and effectively isolate the qubit. By verifying the Jarzynski equality for the distribution of applied work, we demonstrate the validity of the second law of thermodynamics.

This work represents an indispensable and pivotal prerequisite for quantitative first-principle studies of the QCD phase diagram and the hadron spectrum within this framework.    In particular, we have computed the gluon, ghost, quark and scalar-pseudoscalar meson propagators, as well as gluon, ghost-gluon, quark-gluon, quark, quark-meson, and meson interactions. Our results stress the crucial importance of the correct semi-perturbative running of the different vertices in order to quantitatively describe the phenomena and scales of confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking without further phenomenological input.

We solve the Markovian master equation for the time evolution of the considered system and describe the quantum correlations in terms of the covariance matrix for Gaussian input states. Depending on the values of the parameters characterizing the initial state of the system (squeezing parameter, average photon numbers), the coefficients describing the interaction of the system with the reservoir (temperature, dissipation constant), and the intensity of the interaction between the two modes, one may notice phenomena like generation of quantum correlations, their suppression (sudden death), periodic revivals and suppressions, or an asymptotic decay in time of quantum correlations.",2017-08-21 12:00:00+00:00,20 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

1062,Threshold effects in hadron spectrum: a new spectroscopy?,"Between November $1974$, when the $J/\psi$ particle was discovered, and $2003$,     when the $X(3872)$ resonance was hunted by the Belle Collaboration, the     charmonium spectrum was fairly explained by naive quark models. However, the     exploration of the spectrum for energies above the $D\bar{D}$ threshold has led     to the appearance of unexpected states, difficult to accommodate in the naive     quark model picture.    The mentioned $X(3872)$ has properties that cannot be explained assuming a     simple quark-antiquark structure; for example, its decay into $\pi\pi J/\psi$     through a $\rho$ meson is an isospin violating decay. However, this property can     be nicely explained in a picture in which the $X(3872)$ is understood as a     $D\bar D^{\ast}$ bound state, due to the isospin violation in the $D$ and     $D^{\ast}$ masses and the close position of the state to the $D^0\bar D^{*\,0}$     threshold. In addition to the $X(3872)$, there are other states such as the     $D_{s0}(2317)^\ast$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ which can be described as a $DK$ and     $D^\ast K$ molecules, respectively; or the $P^\ast_c(4380)$ and     $P^\ast_c(4450)$ which are two exotic structures discovered in $2015$ by the     LHCb Collaboration in the $J/\psi p$ channel, lie near the $\bar     D\Sigma^{(\ast)}_c$ thresholds and are compatible with pentaquark     interpretations.    The common feature among all these exotic states is the presence of nearby     two-particle thresholds. This reinforces the intuition that the residual     interaction between the two particles can form a new molecular state or     renormalize the mass of the original naive $q\bar q$ state. Some times the     interaction is not enough to bind a molecule and a threshold cusp may be formed.     Then, one can expect that near each meson-meson or baryon-meson thresholds some     new structures might appear. The description of this type of structures is very     tricky from a theoretical point of view because the strength of the residual     interaction is usually model dependent and one can generate spurious states if     this interaction is not under control.    In this talk, we review the status of a threshold effects calculation in the     meson an baryon spectrum using a constituent quark model~[1], that has been     applied to a wide range of hadronic observables and thus all model parameters     are completely constrained. In the meson sector, the model has been able, for     instance, to reproduce the properties of the $X(3872)$ as a mixture of $c\bar c$     and $D\bar D^\ast$ channels~[2]; and to describe well the spectrum of the     $P$-wave charm strange mesons when $DK$ and $DK^\ast$ structures are taken into     account~[3]. In the baryon sector, the model has described the     $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$~[4, 5] as a $D^\ast N$ molecule, the $X_c(3250)$~[6] as     a $D^\ast\Delta$ one, and the $P^\ast_c(4380)$ and $P^\ast_c(4450)$ states as     $\bar D \Sigma^\ast_c$ and $\bar D\Sigma_c$ candidates~[7]. Some new states     which cannot be accommodated as molecular states will be also discussed.    \vspace{1cm}    [1] J. Vijande, F. Fern\'andez, A. Valcarce J. Phys.

1063,New Mathematical Formulation of the Correspondence Principle,"The problem about the classical limit of Quantum Mechanis is a thorny and intriguing issue at the core of modern physics. There remain many doubts about this fundamental question of the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. In the literature,  there are many procedures to aboard this matter, the best known and used are the Planck´s limit ( ) and the Bohr´s Correspondence Principle (n>>1). Nathan Rosen and Richard Libboff have affirmed that this limits are not equivalent and that none of them has a universal charcater.     In this work we propose a new mathematical formulation of the Correspondence Principle. This new approach consists of obtaining the asymptotic limit of quantum probability density. As a result of this procedure, Classical Physics emerges as an asymptotic case of Quantum Mechanics. We show as examples of this procedure the cases of the quantum harmonic oscillator, the Kepler problem, the particle en the square infinity well and the quantum free falling.    With this approach one can understand the difference between the Planck´s limit and the Bohr´s Correspondence Principle.

The Green’s function in 3 + 1 dimensional curved space,"An exact solution to the heat equation in curved space is a much sought after; this report presents a derivation wherein the cylindrical symmetry of the metric in 3 + 1 dimensional curved space has a pivotal role. To elaborate, the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution is a staple of textbooks on general relativity; not so perhaps, the static but cylindrically symmetric ones, though they were obtained almost contemporaneously by H.Weyl,Ann.Phys.Lpz.54,117(1917)     and T.

Using the same Lagrangian density the    second part reported here essentially revisits the second paper by Bormann and Antonsen – arXiv:hep 9608142v1 but relies on the formulation by the author in S.G.Kamath, AIP Conf.Proc.1246,174 (2010) to obtain the Green’s function directly by solving a sequence of first order partial differential equations that is preceded by a second order partial differential equation.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Gopinath Kamath,
1067,Pontryagin trace anomaly,"It is known that quantum field theories defined on curved spacetimes develop quantum anomalies of a trace of the energy-momentum tensor, called trace anomalies. These anomalies can be classified by using cohomology analysis, which in 4D establishes three possible types of trace anomalies: Euler (or Gauss-Bonnet), Weyl and Pontryagin. While the appearance of Euler and Weyl trace anomalies is a generic property confirmed by explicit calculations, e.g., in the simple theory of free massless Dirac or Weyl spin 1/2 field, the status of Pontryagin anomaly is still not resolved. Moreover, several arguments were stated in the literature which apparently forbid appearance of Pontryagin anomaly for free spin 1/2 fields.    In this talk results that counter this standard story will be presented, showing that free Weyl spin 1/2 fermion on curved four-dimensional spacetime has Pontryagin anomaly, with the imaginary coefficient in front of the Pontryagin density. We have obtained this surprising result by explicit one-loop calculations using dimensional regularisation, by two different methods: (1) direct calculation using the Weyl fermion, (2) by exploiting the coupling to “axial gravity”, which allowed us to work with the Dirac instead of the Weyl field. The Pontryagin anomaly of the Dirac and the Majorana spin 1/2 field is vanishing.    This result has some important consequences, some of which will be discussed. One is that the supposed equivalence between quantum free Majorana and Weyl fields in purely gravitational background cannot be correct. There is also a question of the imaginary value of the anomaly, which may possibly signal the problems with chiral theories in which Weyl fermions are not appearing in pairs with both chiralities, or may have some importance in cosmology due to its unusual gravitational parity-odd nature.",2017-08-28 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Predrag Dominis Prester,

In this framework, we define a general quantum computational model based on a continuous variables hardware. It consists in vacuum input states, a finite set of gates — including non-Gaussian elements — and homodyne detection. We show that this model enables the encoding of fault tolerant universal quantum computing. Furthermore, when restricted to only commuting gates it turns into a sampling problem that can’t be simulated efficiently with a classical computer — unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Thus we provide a simple paradigm for short-term experiments relying on Gaussian states, homodyne detection and some form of non-Gaussian evolution.",2017-08-21 14:50:00+00:00,20 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

1069,Gaussian quantum steering of two bosonic modes in a squeezed thermal environment,"Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability of quantum states is a property that is different from entanglement and Bell nonlocality. We describe the time evolution of a recently introduced measure that quantifies steerability for arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states in a system consisting of two bosonic modes embedded in a common squeezed thermal environment.    We work in the framework of the theory of open systems. If the initial state of the subsystem is taken of Gaussian form, then the evolution under completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups assures the preservation in time of the Gaussian form of the states.    It was shown that  the thermal noise and dissipation introduced by the thermal environment destroy the steerability between the two bosonic modes. In the case of the squeezed thermal bath we show the dependence of the Gaussian steering on the squeezing parameters of the bath and of the initial state of the system. A comparison with other quantum correlations for the same system shows that, unlike Gaussian quantum discord, which is decreasing asymptotically in time, the Gaussian quantum steerability suffers a sudden death behaviour, like quantum entanglement.",2017-08-21 12:20:00+00:00,20 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

1075,The MoEDAL Detector at the LHC,The MoEDAL experiment consists of several types of detectors located around the LHCb interaction point at the LHC.  Nuclear track detectors are used to look for highly ionizing particles while trapping detectors allow the detection of magnetically charged particles that stop in their volume.  Solid state MediPix detectors allow characterization of the background particle flux.  The current status of the MoEDAL detector will be discussed along with two planned subdetectors.  The first is a scintillator based detector to monitor MoEDAL trapping volumes for the decays of captured very long-lived highly-ionizing electrically charged particles.  This subdetector will be placed in an underground laboratory to reduce cosmic ray backgrounds.  The second planned subdetector is designed to detect mini-charged particles and will be located approximately 40m from the interaction point of which 30m is shielding rock and concrete.,2017-08-18 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Mini-workshop on Highly Ionising Avatars of New Physics,Mini-workshop on Highly Ionising Avatars of New Physics,Richard Soluk,

1077,Experimental technique for $\mathrm{\bar{p}}$-nucleus annihilation cross section measurements at low energy,The interaction of very low energy $\bar{p}$ and $\bar{n}$ with nuclei is interesting for its influence on both fundamental cosmology and nuclear physics. Measuring the annihilation cross section of antimatter on matter can help in solving the universe matter-antimatter puzzle and could give relevant hints in the definition of strong interaction model parameters as well.    The ASACUSA collaboration recently measured the antiproton-carbon annihilation cross section at 5.3~MeV of kinetic energy of the incoming antiproton. The experimental apparatus consisted in a vacuum chamber containing thin foils ($\sim$0.7--1~$\mu$m) of carbon crossed by a bunched beam of antiprotons from the CERN Antiproton Decelerator (AD). The fraction of antiprotons annihilating on the target nucleons gives origin to charged pions which can be detected and counted by segmented scintillators placed outside the chamber. This work describes the experimental details of the apparatus and the technique to perform the cross section measurements.,2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,,Valerio Mascagna,
1080,The Standard Model Algebra,"A simple geometric algebra is shown to contain automatically the leptons and quarks of a generation of the Standard Model, and the electroweak and color gauge symmetries, without predicting extra particles and symmetries. The algebra is already naturally present in the Standard Model, in two instances of the Clifford algebra Cℓ6, one being algebraically generated by the Dirac algebra and the weak symmetry generators, and the other by a complex three-dimensional representation of the color symmetry, which generates a Witt decomposition which leads to the decomposition of the algebra into ideals representing leptons and quarks. The two instances being isomorphic, the minimal approach is to identify them, resulting in the model proposed here. The Dirac and Lorentz algebras appear naturally as subalgebras acting on the ideals representing leptons and quarks. The resulting representations on the ideals are invariant to the electromagnetic and color symmetries, which are generated by the bivectors of the algebra. The electroweak symmetry is also present, and it is already broken by the geometry of the algebra. The model predicts a bare Weinberg angle θW given by sin2θW=0.25. The model shares common ideas with previously known models, particularly with Chisholm and Farwell, 1996, Trayling and Baylis, 2004, and Furey, 2016.",2017-08-28 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Cristi Stoica,

It is  now well established    that at short relative distances (${\bf r}_{rel} ={\bf r}_i- {\bf    r}_j \leq 1-1.5 \, fm^{-1}$), the two nucleons ""i"" and ""j"" do not    follow the independent-particle motion prediction of the well    known shell model, but, on the contrary, according to recent    theoretical investigations, they are strongly correlated, forming    the so called {\it correlation hole}, which depends  upon the very    nature of the two-nucleon interaction as well as upon the values    of the orbital, $L$, spin, $S$,  and isospin, $T$, momenta  of the     pair. The effects of the correlation hole is to    produce in the ground state of the nucleus a large content of high    momentum components ($k\geq 2k_F$, $k_F$ being the Fermi    momentum),    which are missing in a shell-model description;    these high-momentum components  have indeed been recently detected    and investigated in detail in proton and electron inclusive and    exclusive experiments performed at BNL and Jlab. Besides having    deeply improved our knowledge of nuclei, SRC have also a serious    impact on various fields of physics, like, e.g., the structure of    high density matter \cite{reviewmia,reviewloro}, deep inelastic    scattering and the EMC effect \cite{reviewloro}, total high-energy    neutron-nucleus cross sections and the effects of Glauber-Gribov    shadowing \cite{total}, diffractive hadron-nucleus and    nucleus-nucleus scattering     \cite{nashboris2};  in particular it has been shown    \cite{qnp12,diffraction12}  that Gribov inelastic shadowing    effects, making nuclear matter more transparent, are to a certain    degree canceled by the effects of nucleon-nucleon  SRCs, acting on    the opposite direction.    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    %    \begin{thebibliography}{20}    \bibitem{reviewmia} C.~Ciofi degli Atti,  \textit{In-medium short-range dynamics of nucleons: recent    theoretical and experimental advances}, Physics Report  {\bf 590},    1 (2015).    \bibitem{reviewloro}O.~Hen, G.~A.~Miller, E.~Piasetzky, and L.~B.~Weinstein, \textit{Nucleon-nucleon     correlations and the    quarks within}, arXiv:     1611.09748v3 [nucl.ex]    to appear in Reviews of Modern Physics (2017).    %    \bibitem{total} M. ~Alvioli, C. ~Ciofi degli Atti, H. ~Morita, V. ~Palli, \textit{On the effects of correlations on the    total neutron-nucleus cross section at high energies}, Phys.

1086,Double Chooz double-detector results,"Double Chooz is a reactor antineutrino disappearance experiment located in Chooz, France, to measure the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. By detecting the unique inverse beta decay (IBD) prompt-delayed signal antineutrinos can be precisely identified. The experiment consists of two liquid scintillator detectors of identical design; a far detector at a distance of about 1 km is operating since 2011; a near detector at a distance of about 400 m is operating since begin 2015. This double-detector setup with iso-flux configuration allows to fit the far detector data to the near detector data without relying on the reactor neutrino flux prediction where systematic uncertainties are suppressed to per mill level. Statistical uncertainties are reduced by not only using the delayed signal of neutron capture on Gadolinium but adding neutron captures on Hydrogen yielding a statistics increase of more than a factor of two.    To validate the measurement and suppression mechanism in the fit, multiple statistical methods as well as multiple fit configurations using the two detectors have been developed in Double Chooz. They are supplementary to each other to deliver a precise and accurate $\theta_{13}$ value. This contribution will present the latest results of the Double Chooz collaboration.",2017-08-28 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,Other Topics,Denise Hellwig,

Unfortunately only few data exist for very low energy antiprotons (p<500 MeV/c) on medium and heavy nuclei.     A deeper knowledge is required by fundamental physics and can have consequence also in cosmology and medical physics.    In order to fill the gap, the ASACUSA Collaboration has very recently measured the annihilation cross section of 100 MeV/c antiproton on carbon.    In the present work the experimental result is presented together with a comparison both with the antineutron data on the same target at the same energies and with the other existing antiproton data at higher energies.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,,Luca Venturelli,
1088,"The ATLAS Run-2 Trigger Menu for higher luminosities: Design, Performance and Operational Aspects","The ATLAS experiment aims at recording about 1 kHz of physics collisions, starting with an LHC design bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz. To reduce the massive background rate while maintaining a high selection efficiency for rare physics events (such as beyond the Standard Model physics), a two-level trigger system is used. Events are selected based on physics signatures such as presence of energetic leptons, photons, jets or large missing energy. The trigger system exploits topological information, as well as multi-variate methods to carry out the necessary physics filtering. In total, the ATLAS online selection consists of thousands of different individual triggers.    A trigger menu is a compilation of these triggers which specifies the physics algorithms to be used during data taking and the bandwidth a given trigger is allocated. Trigger menus reflect not only the physics goals of the collaboration for a given run, but also take into consideration the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC and limitations from the ATLAS detector readout and offline processing farm. For the 2017 run, the ATLAS trigger has been enhanced to be able to handle higher instantaneous luminosities (up to 2.0x10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}) and to ensure the selection robustness against higher average multiple interactions per bunch crossing.    In this presentation, we describe the design criteria for the trigger menus used for Run 2 at the LHC. We discuss several aspects of the process, from the validation of the algorithms, the fine-tuning of the prescales, and the monitoring tools that ensure the smooth operation of the trigger during data-taking. We also report on the physics performance of a few trigger algorithms.",2017-08-23 14:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Arantxa Ruiz Martinez,
1089,Invisible Trojan-horse attack,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote parties, Alice and Bob, to obtain symmetric keys – random but correlated sequence of bits – by exchanging quantum states [1]. The security relies on the fact that an adversary Eve cannot eavesdrop without introducing noticeable errors. However, due to gaps existing between theory and practice, it is often possible for an eavesdropper, Eve to implement some attacks to extract information about the keys without introducing noticable errors. Such gaps can arise due to imperfections in the physical devices and/or incorrect assumptions in the theoretical security proofs [2,3]. Hence, before trying to promote and commercialize QKD, it is of utmost importance to identify these gaps and evaluate their effects on the security.    This is where security evaluation of QKD comes in. It involves investigating practical QKD implementations to identify such theory-practice deviations, demonstrate the resultant vulnerability, and propose countermeasures to protect Alice and Bob from Eve. In this work, we have done such a security evaluation of the practical QKD system Clavis2 [4] running the Scarani-Acin-Ribordy-Gisin QKD protocol [5]. We evaluated security against the so- called Trojan-horse attack (THA) [6].    In a THA, Eve can probe the properties of a component inside Alice or Bob by sending in a bright pulse into the system and analyzing a suitable back-reflected portion of it. This attack was previously attempted [7] at telecom wavelength with the intention to breach the security of a similar system and was successful in remotely reading the phase modulator settings in Bob via a homodyne measurement. However, the resultant increase in afterpulsing [8] at Bob’s InGaAs single-photon detectors (SPDs) led to an elevated quantum bit error rate (QBER) which disclosed the presence of Eve.    In this work, we have tested the experimental feasibility of a Trojan-horse attack that remains nearly invisible and evaluated the security of Clavis2 system against it. The invisibility has been achieved by using a different wavelength where detectors are expected to be less sensitive. To quantify the decrease in afterpulsing probabilities, we have compared the afterpulsing at λl = 1924 nm with that at λs = 1536 nm.    From Eve’s point of view, the benefit of reduced afterpulsing at λl comes at the expense of a much higher attenuation inside Bob. Additionally, the degree of modulation received at λl differs from that at λs substantially. We quantify the increased optical attenuation and the suboptimal modulator response by means of further experimental measurements. Taking all these factors into account as well as optimizing the attack path through Bob, we evaluate the attack performances in the long wavelength regime. By means of a numerical simulation, we conclude that a Trojan- horse attack at λl can extract keys from the system at the same time being invisible to Alice and Bob. The invisible nature of the current attack poses a threat to the security of practical QKD if proper countermeasures are not adopted. We end by remarking that the attack can be mitigated by using a wavelength filter at the input of the QKD device.    [1] C. H. Bennett and G.

1091,New Baryonic and Mesonic Observables from NA61/SHINE,"One of the main objectives of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN SPS is to search for the critical point on the transition line between the two phases of matter, the quark-gluon plasma and hadron gas. In this talk we present first results on three new observables relevant for the properties of the system as it cools back from the QGP down to the hadronic phase, which recently enriched the NA61/SHINE strong interaction programme.    We investigate proton density fluctuations as a possible order parameter of the phase transition in the neighborhood of the critical point. To this end, we perform an intermittency analysis of the proton second scaled factorial moments (SSFMs) in transverse momentum space. A previous analysis of this sort revealed significant power-law fluctuations in the NA49 heavy ion collision experiment for the “Si”+Si system at 158A GeV/c. The fitted power-law exponent was consistent with the theoretically expected critical value, within errors, a result suggesting a baryochemical potential for the critical point in the vicinity of ~250 MeV. We now extend the analysis to NA61 systems of similar size, Be+Be and Ar+Sc, at 158A GeV/c.    We present the first ever measurements of Phi meson production in p+p collisions at 40 and 80 GeV/c, and most detailed ever experimental data at 158 GeV/c. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of the present dataset with respect to existing measurements. The comparison of p+p to Pb+Pb collisions demonstrates a non-trivial system size dependence of the longitudinal evolution of hidden strangeness production, contrasting with that of other mesons.    The electromagnetic (EM) effects on charged meson production give, for the first time, a consistent picture of the longitudinal evolution of the system at SPS energies. We discuss the role of energy-momentum conservation in the latter and present feasibility studies for EM effects in Be+Be, Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisions as a function of their centrality and energy.",2017-08-24 09:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Antoni Marcinek,

1093,Event topology reconstruction in the CBM experiment at FAIR,"One of the main purposes of the physics program of the future heavy ion experiment CBM (FAIR, Germany) is to understand the properties of strongly interacting matter at very high baryonic densities and to study the possibility of a phase transition to a deconfined and chirally restored phase of quark matter. The experiment will operate at high interaction rates up to 10 MHz, that requires a full event reconstruction in real time.     In order to make an efficient event selection online a clean sample of particles has to be provided by the reconstruction package called First Level Event Selection (FLES). The FLES package operates in two stages. First, particles registered in the CBM detector system are reconstructed. Then short-lived particles decayed before or inside the setup are searched based on their charged and neutral daughter particles. Since the FLES package is developed to run on many-core computer architectures, the reconstruction of particles is done in parallel that provides a possibility for a global competition between particle candidates. Such a global event topology reconstruction significantly improves suppression of a combinatorial background and provides for further physics analysis a very clean sample of particles produced at different stages of heavy ion collision.     The global event topology reconstruction procedure and the results of its application to simulated collisions in the CBM detector setup are presented and discussed in details.",2017-08-25 06:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Ivan Kisel,
1094,Ultrafast Quantum Key Distribution with Ultra-Broad Squeezed Light,"A scheme for parallel, high-throughput continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) is presented that efficiently utilizes the optical bandwidth resource of broadband squeezed vacuum (of order $10-100$THz), using a novel method for broadband spectrally resolved parametric homodyne measurement. Large multi-bit frames of data can be encoded simultaneously onto the squeezed vacuum spectrum by shaping its spectral phase using a Fourier-domain pulse shaper. This data can later be decoded at the receiving end by measuring the spectral quadrature fluctuation across the entire spectrum on a linear array of fast detectors using the pump field as a single local oscillator for all frequency pairs in the spectrum. The speed-up of the proposed protocol compared to standard protocols is proportional to the number of detectors in the array, which ideally can reach $10^5$ (defined by the ratio of the total bandwidth to the modulation rate of a single channel), and practically can be well over 100.     Our Scheme relies on a common version of CV-QKD, where the data is encoded onto the amplitude and phase of squeezed vacuum light (or the field quadratures) and is read out by coherent homodyne detection against a local oscillator [1]. CV-QKD is considered faster than discrete variable QKD because of the technical details of homodyne detection, which allow faster measurement than photon counting. In addition it may allow use of multiple photons per detection (and transfer multiple data bits per detection correspondingly) [2]. The security of the communication relies on the inability to measure both quadratures simultaneously, indicating that a receiving party can measure only one quadrature with no information on the other. Moreover, variation of the quadrature axis (phase of the pump) between (0,π⁄2) and (π⁄4,-π⁄4) naturally defines two mutually exclusive bases, where measurement along the (π⁄4,-π⁄4) axis cannot provide any information for a state that was squeezed along the other (0,π⁄2) axis, very similar to measuring the polarization of a single photon along the wrong axis of polarization.     **References**    1.

1095,Relativity with a preferred frame. Astrophysical and cosmological implications,"The present analysis is motivated by the fact that, although the local Lorentz invariance is one of the cornerstones of modern physics, cosmologically a preferred system of reference does exist.    Modern cosmological models are based on the assumption that there exists a typical (privileged) Lorentz frame, in which the universe appear isotropic to ""typical"" freely falling observers.    The discovery of the cosmic microwave background provided a stronger support to that assumption    (it is tacitly assumed that the privileged frame, in which the universe appears isotropic, coincides with the CMB frame).     The view, that there exists a preferred frame of reference, seems to unambiguously lead to the abolishment of the basic principles of the special relativity theory: the principle of relativity    and the principle of universality of the speed of light.     Correspondingly, the modern    versions of experimental tests of special relativity and the ""test theories"" of special relativity    reject those principles and presume that a preferred inertial reference frame, identified with the CMB frame, is the only frame in which    the two-way speed of light (the average speed from source to observer and back) is isotropic    while it is anisotropic in relatively moving frames.    In the present study, the existence of a preferred frame is incorporated into the framework of the special relativity, based on the relativity principle and universality of the (two-way) speed of light, at the expense of the freedom in assigning the one-way speeds of light that exists in special relativity.    In the framework developed, a degree of anisotropy of the one-way speed    acquires meaning of a characteristic of the really existing anisotropy caused by motion of an inertial frame relative to the preferred frame.    The anisotropic special relativity kinematics    is developed based on the first principles: (1) Space-time transformations between inertial frames leave the equation of anisotropic light propagation    invariant and (2) A set of the transformations possesses a group structure. The Lie group theory apparatus is applied as in [1] to define groups of transformations.    The corresponding extension to general relativity, like the standard general relativity, is based on the existence of locally inertial frames and the equivalence principle. Despite the fact that, in the special relativity with a preferred frame developed as described above, the interval is not invariant but conformally modified under the transformations between inertial frames, the complete apparatus of general relativity can be applied  based on the existence of an invariant combination which, upon a change of the time and space variables, takes the form of the Minkowski interval. However, to calculate physical effects, an inverse change of variables to  the 'physical' time and space is needed. Among the applications of the relativity with a preferred frame, is a possible resolution of the so-named 'acceleration problem' which appeared after the discovery that the present expansion of the universe is accelerated, made using the luminosity distance versus redshift relation of type Ia supernovae. It is interpreted as that the time evolution of the expansion rate cannot be described by a matter-dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological model of the universe. In order to explain the discrepancy within the context of General Relativity, a new component of the energy density of the universe, known as Dark Energy (vacuum energy), with exotic properties is usually introduced, and also some other non-standard alternatives are considered. In the framework of the relativity with a preferred frame, the deceleration parameter in the luminosity distance - redshift relation is corrected such that the observed deceleration parameter can be negative. Thus, the observed negative values of the deceleration parameter do not exclude the Friedman dynamics corresponding to the matter-dominated decelerating universe.

1096,Charmed states on the lattice,"Study of the charmonium states play important role in understanding of the strong interaction. The most interesting charmonium states lie near or above open charm thresholds. Nature of such states is of interest to modern physics. Recent lattice calculations have performed the necessary extrapolations and considered spectra as well as certain radiative transitions. The lattice QCD simulations of $X(3872)$ with $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ have been performed in this study. The mass of this state , $3872$ MeV, is very close to the sum of the masses of the $D^0$ and $\overline{D^{0*}}$ mesons and decays to $D^0$ and $\overline{D^{0*}}$ were observed, giving rise to two other explanations for what the mysterious X could be: a loosely-bound “molecule” of the  $D^0$ and $\overline{D^{0*}}$ mesons, or a “tetra-quark” binding a di-quark and a di-antiquark. We also have proposed the approach to determine the nature of this state.",2017-08-23 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Olga Solovjeva,
1097,Stiff self-interacting strings in high temperature phase of QCD.,"We investigate the predictions of Nambu-Goto (NG) and Polyakov-Kleinert (PK) effective string actions for the Casimir energy and the width of the quantum delocalization of the string at two loop order in 4-dim pure SU(3) Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory. Intermediate and large color source separation distance, before the string breaks in full QCD, at two temperature scales are considered near the deconfinement point.     At a temperature closer to the critical point $T /T_c = 0.9$, we found that the next to leading-order (NLO) contributions from the expansion of the NG string to improve the match to lattice data in the intermediate distance scales for both the quark-antiquark potential and broadening of the color tube compared to the free string approximation. Nevertheless, the Nambu-Goto string action in the next-to-leading order approximation does not provide a precise match with the numerical data for both the quark-antiquark potential and broadening profile.    We conjecture possible stiffness of the QCD string through studying the effects of extrinsic curvature term in Polyakov-Kleinert action. The consequences of adding a smoothing term proportional to the extrinsic curvature to the Nambu-Goto string action, as suggested by Polyakov, are investigated. The mean square width of the flux tube of the smooth open-string is derived considering Dirichelet boundary condition. We find that the theoretical predictions derived based on this smooth string formalism return a good fitting behavior for the lattice Mont-Carlo data at both long and intermediate quark separations regions.",2017-08-19 13:30:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Special Session on QCD,Special session on QCD - from vacuum to finite temperatures,Ahmed Bakry,

In particular, a proof is given on the incompatibility between the collapse in the standard quantum measurement scheme and the conservation of angular momentum. As an alternative, it is argued that a single unitary evolving solution can account for quantum experiments without collapse, even when non-commuting observables are measured in succession.

1101,The fate of Quarkonia in an Anisotropic hot QCD medium within a Quasi-Particle Model,"We work on equations of state for hot QCD obtained from a hard thermal loop expression for the gluon self-energy, by employing the quasi-parton equilibrium distribution functions. The method involves mapping the interaction part of the equation of state to an effective fugacity of otherwise non-interacting quasi-gluons. Using the quasi-gluon distribution function, we have studied the dissociation of heavy Quarkonium in hot QCD medium by investigating the medium modification to a heavy quark potential. We further study the flavor dependence of their binding energies by employing the Debye mass for    pure gluonic and full QCD case. In the present article, we shall consider an anisotropic QGP medium which is described in terms of quasi-particle degree of freedom based on a recent proposed quasi-particle model for hot QCD equation of state. The presence of anisotropy makes the real-part of the potential stronger but the imaginary-part is weakened slightly. However, since the medium corrections to the imaginary-part is a small perturbation to the vacuum part, overall the anisotropy makes the dissociation    temperatures higher, compared to isotropic medium.",2017-08-28 07:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Indrani nilima,

1103,Weak Measurements: from Measuring Non-Commuting Observables and Testing Quantum Contextuality to Protective Measurements,"Measurements are the very basis of Physics, especially in Quantum Mechanics (QM), where they assume even a more fundamental role because of the wave function collapse occurring after a “strong” (projective) measurement. Furthermore, measuring a quantum-mechanical observable completely erases the information on its conjugate one (e.g., position measurement erases information on momentum, and vice-versa).    Nevertheless, in QM other kinds of measurement are possible. For example, wave function collapse can be overcome through Weak Measurements, i.e. measurements performed with an interaction weak enough to avoid inducing the original state collapse, featuring several interesting properties.     An example of these are weak values [1-3], realised for the first time in [4-6], that have been used for addressing fundamental questions [7-12] as Contextuality and are also a tool for Quantum Metrology [13-19].    One of the most intriguing properties of Weak Measurements is that, since they are not affected by wave function collapse, they can allow gathering simultaneous information on non-commuting observables [20], impossible with the standard (projective) measurement protocols.    A second example is offered by Protective Measurements [21], a new technique able to extract information on the expectation value of an observable even measuring a single particle.    In this talk, after a general introduction to WMs, we present the first realisation of sequential weak value measurements [22], i.e. a measurement of the weak value of (incompatible) polarizations in sequence on a single photon.    Then, we present an experiment addressed to explore the connection between anomalous weak values and Contextuality [23], showing a clear violation of the inequality proposed in [12] while satisfying all the additional theoretical requests, unequivocally demonstrating the contextual nature of weak values.       Finally, we present and discuss the first implementation of Protective Measurements, showing unprecedented measurement capability and demonstrating how the expectation value of an observable can be obtained even with a single experiment on a single particle.

We evaluate the decay widths from the pion emission for the known excited $\Lambda_c^*$ (Lc(2595), Lc(2625), Lc(2765), Lc(2880), Lc(2940)) baryons.  We find that we can explain the decay widths of the low-lying $\Lambda_c^*$ and also predict those for higher excited $\Lambda_c^*$.  It is interesting that, however, the large decay width of Lc*(2765) cannot be explained by a simple quark model.

1107,Inflation Scheme Derived From Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory,"In physical cosmology, inflation is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe. Inflation is so far the mostly accepted way to solve the fine-tuning problems with the initial conditions of the universe. Inflation hypothesis can explain why our universe appears flat, homogeneous, and isotropic. It can explain the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos and why no magnetic monopoles have been detected. The hypothetical particle or field thought to be responsible for inflation is called inflaton. However, the detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation or inflaton remains unknown.     In this work, we study the inflation scheme in a new development in string theory, universal function interpretation of string theory (UFIST). We find that UFIST reveals to us the possible candidates of inflaton. From UFIST, we can calculate or estimate the vacuum energy responsible for the inflation as well as the energy source that drives the continued accelerated growth of our universe. We will show that our calculation is consistent with the current observation.

The beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator is a novel accelerator technique being developed for this purpose. The field has recently seen a rapid experimental progress. The AWAKE experiment at CERN is the first proton-driven plasma wakefield accelerator experiment. It uses the self-modulation instability (SMI) to transform the 12 cm long, 400 GeV proton bunch from the SPS into a train of bunches spaced by the plasma wavelength (~ 1mm). The train can then resonantly drive GV/m fields that can be used to accelerate electrons over 10s to 100s of meters. The first experiments started in December 2016 aiming at measuring the parameters of the proton bunch after it has experienced the SMI in a 10 m long rubidium plasma with an electron density in the 1-10e14/cm3 range.

1109,Pion-Dressing Effects in Nucleon and Delta Masses and Form Factors,"Low-energy baryons can be effectively described with regard to most of their properties on the basis of valence-quark configurations. This is particularly the case for the baryonic ground states, e.g. along the relativistic constituent-quark model, lattice quantum chromodynamics, or effective field theories. However, all approaches based on quantum chromodynamics presently struggle with a proper description of baryon resonances. The reasons mainly lie in their strong couplings to a number of hadronic decay channels, which have usually not yet been taken into account explicitly.    In the attempt to construct a relativistic coupled-channels quark model going beyond valence-quark degrees of freedom, we have made a study of explicit pionic effects for the nucleon and Delta. In particular we have investigated in a relativistic coupled-channels framework the influences of the pion channel on the nucleon and Delta masses as well as the pion-nucleon/Delta interaction vertices. Sizeable effects are found already for one-pion dressing. We take this as an indication of the absolute necessity of explicitly including strong-decay channels in a realistic description especially of baryon resonances.",2017-08-18 07:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special Session on QCD,Special session on QCD - from vacuum to finite temperatures,Willibald Plessas,

1116,Cosmic Electroweak Monopole,"We discuss the cosmological production and the successive    evolution of the electroweak monopole in the standard    model, and estimate the remnant monopole density at present     universe. We confirm that, although the electroweak phase     transition is of the first order, it is very mildly first     order. So, the monopole production arises from the thermal     fluctuations of the Higgs field after the phase transition,     not the vacuum bubble collisions during the phase transition.     Moreover, while the monopoles are produced copiously around     the Ginzburg temperature $T_G\simeq 59.6~{\rm TeV}$, most     of them are annihilated as soon as created. This annihilation     process continues very long, untill the temperature cools     down to about 29.5 MeV. As the result the remnant monopole     density in the present universe becomes very small, of     $10^{-11}$ of the critical density, too small to affect     the standard cosmology and too small comprise a major     component of dark matter.

Its main advantages are that    gauge invariant structures can be generated by certain systematic integration-by-parts procedures, making    unnecessary the usual tedious analysis of the non-abelian off-shell Ward identities, and that the scalar,    spinor and gluon loop cases can be treated in a unified way.

1121,Coherent Diffusive Photonics,"N. Korolkova, University of St. Andrews, UK; D. Mogilevtsev, Istitute of Physics, Belarus Academy of Sciences,Belarus; S. Mukherjee,  R. R. Thomson, Heriott-Watt University, UK.    The engineering of dissipation to a common reservoir generates a vast array of novel structures for photonic application and quantum simulation [1]. We suggest here  novel possibilities for photonics that are generated by diffusive light propagation [2]. The dissipative coupling of bosonic modes can allow light to flow like heat, whilst retaining coherence and even entanglement. The Photonic Circuit has generally been a structure in which light propagates by unitary exchange and where photons transfer reversibly between channels. In contrast, the term ‘diffusive’ is more akin to a chaotic propagation in scattering media, where light is driven out of coherence towards a thermal mixture.  We have devised a way to unite these opposites, founded from the dynamics of open quantum systems and resulting in novel techniques for coherent light control. The crucial feature of these photonic structures is dissipative coupling between modes; an interaction with a common reservoir.  We demonstrate experimentally that such systems can perform optical equalisation to smooth multimode light, or act as a distributor, guiding it into selected channels. Quantum thermodynamically, these systems can act as catalytic coherent reservoirs by performing perfect non-Landauer erasure. When extending to lattice structures, localized stationary states can be supported in the continuum, similar to compacton-like states in conventional flat band lattices. In the future, we believe that diffusive photonic systems will find practical application both in studying the fundamental processes of structurally engineered open systems and in an array of integrated photonic technologies.

The definition of Shannon entropy as well as the notions on joint, conditional, and mutual entropy as defined by Shannon can all be derived by a uniform transformation from the corresponding formulas of logical information theory. Information is first defined in terms of sets of distinctions without using any probability measure. When a probability measure is introduced, the logical entropies are simply the values of the (product) probability measure on the sets of distinctions. The compound notions of joint, conditional, and mutual entropies are obtained as the values of the measure, respectively, on the union, difference, and intersection of the sets of distinctions. These compound notions of logical entropy satisfy the usual Venn diagram relationships (e.g., inclusion-exclusion formulas) since they are values of a measure (in the sense of measure theory). The uniform transformation into the formulas for Shannon entropy is linear so it explains the long-noticed fact that the Shannon formulas satisfy the Venn diagram relations—as an analogy or mnemonic—since Shannon entropy is not a measure in the sense of measure theory) on a given set.    What is the logic that gives rise to logical information theory? Partitions are dual (in a category-theoretic sense) to subsets, and the logic of partitions was recently developed in a dual/parallel relationship to the Boolean logic of subsets (the latter being usually mis-specified as the special case of ""propositional logic""). Boole developed logical probability theory as the normalized counting measure on subsets. Similarly the normalized counting measure on partitions is logical entropy--when the partitions are represented as the set of distinctions that is the complement to the equivalence relation for the partition.    The 'classical' logical notion of entropy extends directly to the quantum case where a partition is replaced by the direct-sum decomposition defined by the eigenspaces of an observable. The multivariate notions of joint, conditional, and mutual logical entropy extend directly to the corresponding quantum notions for commuting observables.",2017-08-24 14:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,David Ellerman,
1124,Three-fluid Hydrodynamics-based Event Simulator Extended by UrQMD final State interactions  (THESEUS) for FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC energies,"A new event generator is presented which is based on the three-fluid hydrodynamics approach for the early stage of the collision, followed by a particlization at the hydrodynamic decoupling surface    to join to a microscopic transport model, UrQMD, to account for hadronic final state interactions.    The new simulation program has the unique feature that it can describe a hadron-to-quark matter transition     which proceeds in the baryon stopping regime that is not accessible to previous simulation programs designed for higher energies.    First results for nuclear collisions of the FAIR/NICA energy scan program     (Au+Au collisions, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4-11$ GeV) are presented.    The following topics are addressed: the directed flow, transverse-mass spectra, and rapidity distributions     of protons,  pions and kaons for two model EoS,     one with a first-order phase transition, the other with a crossover transition.     Preliminary results on the femtoscopy are also discussed.",2017-08-24 06:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Yu.

A sensitive search for LSND like anomalous nu_e appearance was performed, contributing to constrain the allowed parameters to a narrow region around Δm$^2$~eV$^2$, where all the experimental results can be coherently accommodated at 90% C.L.     The T600 detector will be redeployed at Fermilab, after a significant overhauling, to be exposed to the Booster Neutrino Beam acting as the far station to search for sterile neutrino within the SBN program.

1126,The new front end and DAQ of the ICARUS detector,"Icarus is the largest imaging LAr TPC ever operated. During its LNGS run on the CNGS neutrino beam, from 2010 to 2013, produced some thousands neutrino events of unprecedented quality. This was possible thanks its mechanical precision and stability, liquid argon purity and electronics front-end and DAQ. In this poster the last issue (front-end and DAQ) will be presented in detail. Actually Icarus T600, in view of its operation at FNAL on the SBN neutrino beam, is undergoing a major overhauling that implies cathode mechanics improvement, additional PMTs installation and a new electronics front-end and DAQ. This electronics implements a new architecture, integrated onto the flange proprietary design, and a new front-end that improves S/N and induction signals treatment. Also this issue will be presented in detail together with data recently recorder at CERN in the Icarino, 50 litres, LAr facility.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,,Christian Farnese,

1128,Calculations of coherent photon-nucleus and photon-photon interactions in hadronic A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC,"The coherent photon-nucleus and photon-photon interactions has been studied in detail at RHIC and LHC to probe the gluon distribution in nucleus at low Feynman $x$ via relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These kind of interactions are traditionally thought to only exist in ultra-peripheral collisions, where there is no hadronic interactions. Recently, a significant excess of $J/\psi$ yield at very low transverse momentum ($p_T < 0.3$ GeV/c) was observed by the ALICE and STAR collaborations in peripheral A+A collisions, which points to evidence of coherent photoproduction of $J/\psi$ in violent hadronic interactions. The survival of photoproduced $J/\psi$ merits theoretical investigation. In addition, with respect to the expectation of theoretical calculations, the excess yield of $J/\psi$ in hadroinc heavy-ion collisions may served as a good probe to test the cold and hot medium effects.    In this presentation we report on calculations of coherent photon-nucleus ($\gamma + A \rightarrow J/\psi + A$) and photon-photon ($\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$) interactions in hadronic A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We also address the questions about how the electromagnetic field translates into a flux of equivalent photons in hadronic A+A collisions: if the photons is emitted from the whole nucleus, or if only the spectator fragments contribute to the photon emission. Similarly, for photon-nucleus interactions, it is not clear whether the whole nucleus or only spectator fragment act as photon target. The model used to calculate the cross section will be discussed and the expected yield will be compared with experimental results from RHIC and LHC. The differential centrality, rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from calculations will also be compared between different scenarios.",2017-08-28 09:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,Wangmei Zha,
1129,New results from the OPERA experiment,"The OPERA experiment reached its main goal by proving the appearance of $\nu_{\tau}$ in the CNGS $\nu_{\mu}$ beam. A total sample of 5 candidates fulfilling the analysis defined in the proposal was detected with a S/B ratio of about ten allowing to reject the null hypothesis at 5.1 $\sigma$. The search has been extended to $\nu_{\tau}$-like interactions failing the kinematical analysis defined in the experiment proposal to obtain a statistically enhanced, lower purity, signal sample.   Based on the enlarged data sample the estimation of $\Delta m^2_{23}$ in appearance mode is presented. The search for $\nu_{e}$ interactions has been extended over the full data set with a more than twofold increase in statistics with respect to published data. The analysis of the $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_{e}$ channel is updated and the implications of the electron neutrino sample in the framework of the 3+1 sterile model is discussed. An analysis of $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_{\tau}$ interactions in the framework of the sterile neutrino model has also been performed. Moreover the results of the analysis of the annual modulation of the cosmic muon rate  will be presented.",2017-08-29 07:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Sergey Dmitrievsky,
1130,Exotic Baryons at MAMI,"Finding evidence supporting the existence of exotic states is one of the most exciting aspects of modern hadron physics. In contrast to the meson sector, the existence of exotic baryons is much more controversial, especially since the unprecedented episode of the rise and fall of the $uudd\bar{s}$ pentaquark. Recently though, the matter of pentaquarks has been resurrected by the observation of a $c\bar{c}uud$ pentaquark as claimed by the LHCb collaboration. Although there are arguments favoring the inclusion of heavy quarks in stable pentaquarks, the question remains if such and other exotic states could also be formed by $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks only.    The tagged-photon beam experiment A2 at the MAMI electron accelerator facility in Mainz (Germany) allows the study of several photoproduction reactions in which exotic baryons could be involved in. A selection of current activities and recent results will be discussed: In $\eta$ photoproduction off the neutron, the presence of an unusually narrow resonance is one possible explanation for a sharp structure observed in the total cross section. Recently, new insights could be gained by the measurement of spin-dependent cross sections. Experimental data allowing to search for an exotic state in the $KN$ system of $\gamma d\to\Lambda KN$ are also available and undergoing analysis. Furthermore, preliminary results of a search for the dibaryon supposedly discovered by the WASA-at-COSY collaboration were obtained. Finally, a newly approved experiment dedicated to the study of the $\Lambda(1405)$ will be presented.",2017-08-21 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Dominik Werthmüller,

The weak limit theorem, that is,     the asymptotic behavior, of the one-dimensional discrete time quantum walk is analytically shown. From the limit distribution of the discrete time quantum walk, the discrete time quantum walk can be taken as the quantum dynamical simulator of some physical systems. In this talk, we would like to discuss the mathematical structures of the discrete time quantum walk and its experimental implementation.",2017-08-23 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Yutaka Shikano,
1133,Quantum Cryptography with Structured Photons,"Complementarity prohibits one to measure two conjugate quantities simultaneously, such as position and momentum, relying on the existence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This property can be used for sharing information securely between two parties, e.g. through the use of quantum key distribution (QKD). Moreover, the no-cloning theorem, a fundamental law in quantum mechanic, guarantees that attempts to copy the sent information will introduce detectable imperfections on the carrier. Therefore, monitoring imperfections (the channel noise), during key sharing, reveals the existence of an eavesdropper.    Photons, the quanta of light, are an excellent candidate for quantum communication since the encoded information can be transmitted with maximum speed, the speed of light, between separated parties without being significantly affected by the environment. The latter lies on the fact that light barely interacts with air, thus the information can be sent over very long distances. There have been efforts to utilise photons as information carriers; protocols using photonic polarisation have been explored, but are limited to a bi-dimensional encoding alphabet. Unlike polarisation, photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) and radial quantum number (RQN), two newly used photon’s degrees of freedom, are inherently unbounded, and thus can be used as an unbounded alphabet for communication purposes. Quantum states of light resulting from an arbitrary coherent superposition of different polarisations, OAM and RQN, are referred to as structured photons; structuring photons may be used to realise higher-dimensional states of light.     In my talk, I will present the recent progress, challenges and development in performing high-dimensional quantum key distribution, quantum hacking as well as our recent achievements in simulating quantum computations with structure photons. These results show that implementing high-dimensional protocols will improve noise resistance, security, and increase data transmission rates.",2017-08-25 09:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Lecture,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Ebrahim Karimi,
1134,Vector states above open charm threshold,"Apart from the traditional vector charmonium states $\psi(3770), \psi(4040), \psi(4160)$, and $\psi(4415)$ above open charm, some experiments have observed a lot of non-traditional vector charmonium state which we call Y states,  such as Y(4260) in $\pi^+\pi^- J/\psi (\pi^0\pi^0 J/\psi)$ line shape, Y(4360) and Y(4660) in $\pi^+pi^-\psi(3686)$ line shape. People also observed the non-traditional state Y(4140) via B decay.    Recently, BESIII Collaboration found that there are finer structures Y(4220) and Y(4320) in $e^+e^-\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^- J/\psi$ line shape around $\sqrt{s}=$ 4.26 GeV, Y(4220) and Y(4390) in $e^+e^-\rightarrow\pi+\pi^-h_c$ line shape around $\sqrt{s}=$ 4.30 GeV. BESIII Collaboration try to search the potential Y state in $e^+e^-\rightarrow\omega\chi_{cJ}$ line shape. However, no any exact conclusion is drawn with the current statistic. BESIII Collaboration also perform a  search for Y(4140) via $e^+e^-\rightarrow \gamma\phi J/\psi$.

1135,Strongly interacting matter in neutron stars,"In this talk I will touch upon several features of modern ab initio low-energy nuclear theory. I will start by discussing what ""ab initio"" means in this context. Specifically, I will spend some time going over nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and their connections with the underlying theory of Quantum Chromodynamics. I will then show how these interactions are combined with many-body techniques to describe infinite nucleonic matter, which is of astrophysical relevance. In addition to results on the equation-of-state of homogeneous matter [1,2,3], I will also discuss recent work on the static response of neutron matter, as well as its consequences for neutron stars [4,5].

1136,Work is the source of gravity,"Relativistic Quantum Information is a novel area of research that aims at understanding the interplay of relativity and quantum physics, using tools from different fields of science, such as Gravity, Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime, Quantum Information, Quantum Metrology and Quantum Thermodynamics.    Research in this area of science has provided novel insight on the role that paradigmatic quantum features, such as entanglement, have in physical processes that encompass relativistic and quantum features. Experiments aimed at testing these predictions, as well as developing novel technologies based on this body of work, are currently being developed.    Ultimately, scientists in this field believe that planned experiments might provide unexpected deviations from the theoretical predictions, an event that will stimulate novel theoretical directions.    We present recent advances in the field of Relativistic Quantum Information. We focus on a newly established line of research that aims at understanding the role of entanglement in the theory of gravitation. On the testable side, we discuss predicted effects of curved spacetime on lab-based experiments and space-based quantum information protocols. On the more challenging and exotic side, we propose the idea that not all energy gravitates.

1139,"Phase supersensitivity in an unbalanced SU(1,1) interferometer","A nonlinear interferometer, generally, is a sequence of two nonlinear effects occurring coherently. We investigate the properties of such an interferometer consisting of two unseeded high-gain degenerate optical parametric amplifiers (DOPAs). This configuration is known in the literature as an SU(1,1) interferometer and it enables achieving the Heisenberg limit in phase sensitivity. Moreover, by making the two DOPAs unbalanced, the parametric gain of the second one considerably exceeding the one of the first one, one can overcome the detection losses [1].     In our experiment, we demonstrate a phase sensitivity overcoming the shot noise limit by more than 2dB, with the number of photons in the interferometer being between 1 and 10. We show that the phase sensitivity is considerably improved by increasing the parametric gain of the second DOPA.     The observed tolerance to detection losses will be very important for phase measurements, including the ones related to gravitational-wave detection, in ‘difficult’ spectral ranges where detection is inefficient.

1142,Strange and Charm Baryon Spectroscopy at J-PARC,"I will introduce two activities on hadron spectroscopy at J-PARC.    (I) Since the $\Lambda(1405)$ hyperon is located just below the $\bar{K}N$ threshold,    it is said that $\Lambda(1405)$ is a deeply bound $\bar{K}N$ state.     There is a long standing argument if $\Lambda(1405)$ has     a so-called double pole structure [1,2,3]. In particular, a chiral    unitary model calculation claims that a pole coupled to the $\bar{K}N$ state    is located at around 1426 MeV [2]. In order to confirm this pole structure,    we propose an experimetal study to measure the $\bar{K}N\rightarrow\pi\Sigma$ scattering    below the $\bar{K}N$ threshold via the $(K^-,n)$ reaction on a deuterium target     at the J-PARC K1.8BR Beam Line [4]. Since the $d(K^-,n)X$ reaction is expected     to enhance the S-wave $\bar{K}N\rightarrow\pi\Sigma$ scattering even below the $\bar{K}N$ threshold,    the spectral shapes provide information on $\Lambda(1405)$ coupled to the $\bar{K}N$ state.    We measured pion-Sigma missing mass spectra in the $d(K^-,n)X$ reactions     in all possible isospin final states.     We will present the spectral shapes and discuss the nature of $\Lambda(1405)$.     (II) Baryons comprized with two light quarks and a heavy quark, such as charmed baryons,     provide unique opportunities to learn diquark correlations in a baryon.    It is important to investigate how quark correlations, such as     diquark and/or hadron clusters, are developped inside hadrons     in order to understand structure of exotic hadrons.    We are planning to construct a new platform on precision spectroscopy     of excited charmed baryons by using a high-resolution, high-momentum, intense pion beam    provided at the High-momentum Beam Line at J-PARC [5].     Masses, widths, decay branching ratios, and production/formation cross sections     of excited charmed baryons reflect their internal structure.    We will measure them by means of missing mass techniques via the $p(\pi^-,D^{*-})$ reaction.    [1] J.A. Oller and U.-G. Meissner, Phys. Lett. B500, 263 (2001).<br>    [2] D. Jido, J. A. Oller, E.

1143,Testing the superposition principle with individual trapped atoms,"We report on a stringent test of the *nonclassicality* of the motion of a massive quantum particle that propagates on a discrete lattice. Measuring temporal correlations of the position of single Cs atoms performing a quantum walk, we observe a 6σ violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality [1]. Our results rigorously exclude (i.e., falsify) any explanation of the motion of a Cs atom based on classical, well-defined trajectories, and indicate instead that the atom must propagate in a superposition of multiple trajectories. For this experimental test, we have devised a new technique to realize ideal negative measurements—namely, the ability to measure a physical object avoiding any direct interaction with it. Interaction-free measurements are a prerequisite for any rigorous LG test, as without it, violations can simply be attributed to an unwitting invasiveness on behalf of the experimenter, rather than to the absence of a *realistic* description.    In 1993, Elitzur and Vaidman proposed a different setup that exploits interaction-free measurements to detect the presence of an object— in a dramatic scenario, a bomb—without interacting with it. In a recent experiment [2], we have implemented the “bomb test” with a single atom trapped in a spin-dependent optical lattice. We show the relation between the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester and Leggett-Garg falsification experiments by demonstrating an experimental violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality by 21σ.    **References:**    [1] C.

1147,The LUCID-2 detector,"The LUCID-2 detector is the main online and offline luminosity provider of the ATLAS experiment. It provides over 100 different luminosity measurements from different algorithms for each of the 2808 LHC bunches. LUCID was entirely redesigned in preparation for LHC Run 2: both the detector and the electronics were upgraded in order to cope with the challenging conditions expected at the LHC center of mass energy of 13 TeV with only 25 ns bunch-spacing. While LUCID-1 used gas as a Cherenkov medium, the LUCID-2 detector is in a new unique way using the quartz windows of small photomultipliers as the Cherenkov medium. The main challenge for a luminometer is to keep the efficiency constant during years of data-taking. LUCID-2 is using an innovative calibration system based on radioactive 207 Bi sources deposited on the quartz window of the readout photomultipliers. This makes it possible to accurately monitor and control the gain of the photomultipliers so that the detector efficiency can be kept stable at a percent level. A description of the detector and its readout electronics will be given, as well as preliminary results on the ATLAS luminosity measurement and related systematic uncertainties.",2017-08-21 14:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special Session on Instruments and Methods in HEP,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Antonio Sbrizzi,

1149,DAMPING OF SIMPLE MODES OF HIGH-ENERGY NUCLEAR EXCITATIONS,"The physical content and some implementations of the semi-microscopic models, which are able to describe the high-energy single-quasiparticle and particle-hole-type nuclear excitations in medium-heavy mass spherical nuclei, are presented in this report. The particle-hole dispersive optical model, developed recently [1], is mainly discussed. Being an extension of the standard and non-standard continuum-RPA versions to a phenomenological (and in average over the energy) consideration of the spreading effect, the model possess a set of unique possibilities in description of the high-energy particle-hole-type nuclear excitations. This set includes the description: of the particle-hole strength distribution in a wide excitation-energy interval, which includes distant “tails” of giant resonances; of the double transition density, which determines the corresponding hadron-nucleus inelastic scattering cross sections; of direct-nucleon-decay properties of the mentioned excitations and related phenomena. Some implementations of the model [2, 3] are presented together with current results concerned with charge-exchange excitations.    As applied to description of deep-hole states, formulation of the single-quasiparticle dispersive optical model in terms od corresponding Green functions [4] is discussed. Such a method allows one to propose an unitary version of the model. This version is employed for a quantitative estimation of the spreading (dispersive) contribution to the optical-model potential.

1152,Towards topological quantum computer,"One of the principal obstacles on the way to quantum computers is the lack of distinguished basis in the space of unitary evolutions and thus the lack of the commonly accepted set of basic operations (universal gates). A natural choice, however, is at hand: it is provided by the quantum R-matrices, the entangling deformations of non-entangling (classical) permutations, distinguished from the points of view of group theory, integrable systems and modern theory of non-perturbative calculations in quantum field and string theory. Observables in this case are (square modules of) the knot polynomials, and their pronounced integrality properties could provide a key to error correction. We suggest to use R-matrices acting in the space of irreducible representations, which are unitary for the real-valued couplings in Chern-Simons theory, to build a topological version of quantum computing.",2017-08-25 11:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Sergey Mironov,
1153,Autonomous quantum machines and finite sized clocks,"The unitary itself is usually described by an external observer that manipulates an interaction. Including this control into a fully quantum description, a so-called “quantum clock”, is thus a critical step to placing quantum protocols on a firm footing as well as understanding the fundamental limitations of quantum clocks; especially since due to information gain-disturbance principles, it is impossible to perform these operations perfectly. Here we present a quantum clock that performs a general energy-preserving unitary autonomously with an error that is *exponentially* small in both the dimension and the energy of the quantum clock.    The full quantum setup, —system to be controlled plus quantum clock— is described by a time independent Hamiltonian. This is crucial if one desires to understand the full quantum limitations to control, since a time dependent Hamiltonian would require external control, not explicitly accounted for. The main result is to show that this setup with a clock initially in a Gaussian superposition state can implement to any desired precision, any energy preserving unitary on the system during an arbitrarily small time interval with a back-reaction on the clock which is exponentially small in both energy and clock dimension. How fast as a function of energy and dimension the error in the back-reaction approaches zero is of paramount importance for understanding quantum resource theories involving time and control, since if the decay in error is too slow, one would have to invest a lot of work in correcting the error, representing an unaccounted-for cost to quantum thermodynamic resource theories.    Previous to this work, it was only known that unitaries can be implemented perfectly in the infinite energy and dimension limit, from which it is impossible to estimate the true cost of control. The model we present for the quantum clock is based on a model introduced by Eugene Wigner in General Relativity and later investigated in the non-relativistic regime by Asher Peres. Crucially, we consider a quantum superposition of so-called “clock states”, in contrast to Asher’s study. This is a crucial difference, which due to quantum constructive and destructive interference, leads to a much more accurate clock which can achieve the exponentially small error.    Our contributions to the field of quantum clocks also has other applications. For example, rather than using the quantum clock to perform timed unitaries on quantum systems, one can also perform weak measurements on the clock to measure time. Preliminary results suggest that our clock outperforms classical clocks governed by stochastic dynamics and the quantum clocks in Asher Pere’s study.    In conclusion, our work has implications for the fundamental limitations to the precision of quantum clocks and other applications such as timed autonomous control via these quantum devices. Our work is also both a benchmark for future implementations, as well as introducing a conjecture on the fundamental limitations of clocks and control.

1159,Mixing of positive and negative frequency waves at the optical horizon,"There exist various conditions under which waves of positive and negative Klein-Gordon norm can be made to convert into each other.    For example, upon propagating  on a curved background, waves of positive and negative norm mix to generate outgoing waves.    As a result of this scattering process, field quanta are spontaneously emitted from the vacuum --- the most famous instance of this effect undoubtedly is the mixing of positive and negative norm waves at the horizon of black holes, which results in a steady thermal flux to be emitted from the hole, Hawking radiation [1].    The event horizon of the black hole is the point at which the curvature of spacetime is such that the escape velocity out to infinity becomes superluminal, thus restricting wave propagation to one direction only: toward the central singularity.    Wave propagation on a curved background geometry is not restricted to astrophysics: it is possible to realise an effectively curved geometry with moving wave media in the laboratory, and, in particular, the kinematics of waves at the horizon [2].    An artificial event horizon can be created when a refractive index front (RIF) is moving at the speed of light in a dispersive optical medium [3].    The RIF could be created by a pulse of light that modifies the refractive index by the optical Kerr effect --- a nonlinear effect by which the refractive index depends upon the square of the electric field in the medium.    Light under the pulse will be slowed and thus the front of the pulse exhibits --- for some frequencies --- a black-hole type horizon capturing light. The back of the pulse acts as an impenetrable barrier, a white-hole horizon.    Both event horizons separate two discrete regions: under the pulse, where light is slow and the pulse moves superluminally and outside the pulse, where the pulse speed is subluminal.    We reveal the properties of spontaneous emission from the vacuum at a moving refractive index step in a dispersive dielectric by expanding on an analytical model for light-matter interaction [4]. We establish the conditions for event horizons as a function of the speed and height of the step in the medium, and study the various configurations of modes of the field in the vicinity of the step with and without analogue horizons. We then analytically calculate the emission spectra from all modes of positive and negative norm in the laboratory frame [5]. We find that, as a result of the various mode configurations, the spectrum is highly structured into intervals with black hole-, white hole-, and no horizon.    The emission spectrum in the laboratory frame is found to be a combination of emissions corresponding to different frequencies in the frame moving with the pulse, leading to a characteristic shape. In particular, the existence of a peak in the ultraviolet, associated with emission into a mode with negative norm, is an interesting feature of our spectrum.    We show how emission in this peak may be stimulated by scattering a coherent wave at the horizon.    We also report on an experiment to study the dynamics of waves at the optical horizon.    A weak CW-probe is made to scatter on a RIF created by an intense, ultrashort pulse in a photonic crystal fibre under fine-tuned horizon-like conditions.    As a result of mode conversion at the horizon, light at different wavelengths is generated: the probe is partially shifted in frequency --- positive-to-positive norm conversion occurs as predicted by our theory.    Furthermore, we investigate the companion effect of stimulated emission in a negative norm wave.    The effect of mode conversion is clearly shown to be a feature of horizon physics.    This experiment is a stimulated version of the spontaneous quantum effect at the heart of Hawking radiation.    [1] S. Hawking, Nature 248, 30 (1974).    [2] W.G. Unruh, Phys. Rev. Let. 46 (1981).

1162,Single Higgs production at LHC as a probe for anomalous Higgs self coupling,"The Higgs trilinear coupling is still a missing piece in the Standard Model puzzle. Although its theoretical value can be extracted from its relation to the mass of the Higgs and the Fermi constant, its measurement through the double Higgs production is particularly challenging. We explore the possibility of probing an anomalous trilinear coupling indirectly, through the production and decay of a single Higgs. Indeed, although these processes do not depend on this coupling at tree level, they are sensitive to the Higgs self-coupling at NLO. This gives us the opportunity to derive the constraints on the trilinear coupling from various observables, like the signal strength of the different channels or the cross-section of the associate Higgs production with top quarks.",2017-08-19 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Mini-Workshop on Latest Results and New Physics in the Higgs Sector,Mini-Workshop on Latest Results and New Physics in the Higgs Sector,Pier Paolo Giardino,

Using nuclear, atomic and spin physics applications, it is shown that interactions of constituents    create stationary states of high complexity with respect to the mean-field basis with observable properties smoothly changing along the spectrum. Both local chaotic features and the global evolution along the spectrum are used to understand many-body physics and define    thermodynamic properties of isolated mesoscopic objects (no heat bath).

1165,Covariant density functionals in nuclear physics and their microscopic origin.,"The description of the structure of nuclei in the framework of effective mean-field models are remarkably successful over almost the entire periodic table. Relativistic and non-relativistic versions of this approach enable an effective description of the nuclear many-body problem as an energy density functional. Such theories are used with great success in all quantum mechanical many-body systems. In Coulombic systems, density functional theory is exact and can be derived from the bare Coulomb force without additional phenomenological parameters.  In nuclear physics with spin and isospin degrees of freedom, the situation is much more complicated due to the strong nucleon-nucleon and three-body forces. At present, all attempts to derive these functionals directly from the bare forces do not reach the required accuracy. In recent years, however, there have been several attempts to derive semi-microscopic functionals. They start with microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations in nuclear matter.  These results are then mapped on a Walecka model to adjust in this way basic properties of the covariant density functionals. Only very few additional, phenomenological parameters are necessary to for a fine-tuning and in this way universal covariant density functionals have been derived  which provide an excellent description of ground states and excited states all over the periodic table with a high predictive power.    These semi-microscopic functionals suffer from the fact, that there form is not directly derived from ab initio calculations, only there parameters are adjusted. Therefore, recently, Relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock    theory in finite nuclei has been used to derive the self-consistent mean field and the ground state properties of spherical doubly closed shell nuclei. Starting from a realistic bare nucleon-nucleon (NN) force adjusted to nuclear scattering data, the relativistic G-matrix is obtained as an effective interaction by  solving the Bethe-Goldstone equation in a self-consistent basis. This G-matrix is inserted in a relativistic Hartree-Fock code for finite nuclei and in each step of the iteration a new G-matrix is calculated by solving the Bethe-Goldstone equation for the Pauli-operator derived from the corresponding Fermi surface in the finite system. The self-consistent solution of this iteration process allows to calculate ground state properties of finite nuclei without any adjustable parameters. No three-body forces are used. First results are shown for the doubly magic nuclei $^{4}$He, $^{16}$O, and $^{48}$Ca. Their ground state properties, such as binding energies, charge radii, or spin-orbit splittings are largely improved as compared with the results obtained from non-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. It is discussed that this theory provides a method to study  also the ground state properties of heavy nuclei in \textit{ab initio} calculations.    $^{*}$ Work supported by the DFG (Germany) cluster of excellence ""Origin and    Structure of the Universe"" (www.universe-cluster.de)",2017-08-21 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,S.

1166,Self-consistent description of particle-phonon coupling effects. Pole and tadpole diagrams.,"Since the famous article of 1959 by S.T. Belyaev [1], a crucial role of the first 2+ excitations in even-even nuclei, the quadrupole “phonons”, is one of conventional cornerstones of nuclear theory. The quadrupole phonons are the surface vibrations, belonging to the Goldstone branch  related to the spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry in nuclei. In the modern self-consistent nuclear theories based on the use of the effective energy density functionals (EDFs), a problem of accounting for effects of particle-phonon coupling (PC) effects looks rather delicate as they are included to the EDF phenomenological parameters on average. Hence, there is a problem of ”double counting”.    Within the self-consistent Theory of Finite Fermi Systems (TFFS), we developed a model for    consideration of the PC corrections to electromagnetic moments of odd spherical nuclei in which the fluctuating part of such corrections is taken into account only. The main idea of this model is to separate and explicitly consider such PC diagrams that behave in a non-regular way, depending significantly on the nucleus under consideration and the single-particle state of the odd nucleon. The rest (and the major part) of the PC corrections is supposed to be regular and included in the initial values of the TFFS parameters. In addition to the usual pole diagrams, so-called tadpole ones are included to the calculation scheme. The self-consistent scheme we use is based on the Fayans EDF [2].    In such approach, the quadruple phonos are most important, as their collectivity behaves in a    non-regular way, changing dramatically from double magic nuclei to non-magic neighbors. The model is developed for semi-magic nuclei, which contain a superfluid subsystem and a normal one, and besides the odd nucleon belongs to the normal subsystem. It simplifies the problem drastically. In addition, a non-regular behavior of the PC corrections is typical namely for the normal subsystem  of a semi-magic nucleus. The model was used for finding PC corrections to the magnetic [3] and quadrupole [4] moments of the proton-odd neighbors of the even Pb and Sn isotopes.   Among the PC terms, the ”end correction” and the induced interaction one are sufficiently bigger than all other. However, they have opposite signs and cancel each other significantly. Therefore, the self-consistency of the calculations is of primary importance. In the result, ”small corrections”, in particular the one due to the magnetic moment or quadrupole moment of the phonon, play also a role. In the last case, the tadpole diagram is of principal importance. In our calculations, rather good description of the data was obtained without any adjusted parameters.    1. S.T. Belyaev, Mat.-Fys.

Thus, a simple theory for the generation of the soft masses would be more compelling. Recently, our group discussed in two sequential papers a new approach to dynamical supersymmetry breaking via Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model, which has been missed since the first investigation of supersymmetric NJL model. We introduce a four-superfield interaction term that induces a real two-superfield composite with vacuum condensate. The latter has supersymmetry breaking parts, which we show to bear nontrivial solutions following a standard nonperturbative analysis for a NJL type model. In the talk, I will discuss this possibility of dynamical supersymmetry breaking, and present the prototype model, with the analysis of effective theory picture.

In an almost parameter-free    calculation, the $X(3862)$,  $X(3872)$, and $X(3930)$ state could be    simultaneously produced with a quite good accuracy by coupling the    three P-wave states, $\chi_{c2}(2P)$, $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, $\chi_{c0}(2P)$    predicted in the Godfrey-Isgur model to  the $D\bar D$, $D\bar D^{*}$, $D^*\bar D^*$    continuum states. At the same time, we predict that the $h_c(2P)$    state is at about 3890 MeV with a width of about 44 MeV. In this    calculation, the $X(3872)$ state has a large compositeness.

First, we will discuss fluctuations in the nearby environment probed by an interference of atoms trapped in a magnetic lattice very close (5μm) to a room temperature surface [2,3]. Here an order-of-magnitude improvement has been obtained over previous atom-surface distances for which spatial interference has been observed. Next, we will present a new interferometry of self-interfering clocks and show, in a proof-of-principle experiment, how it could probe the interplay of QM and GR [4].

This implies that, irrespective of their flavor content, tetraquarks    should have narrow widths, of the order of $N_c^{-2}$, i.e., an order    of magnitude smaller in $N_c$ than the widths of ordinary mesons.

1180,The STAR detector upgrade and future plan,"The second phase of the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC, BES-II, is scheduled for 2019-2020 and will explore with precision measurements the high baryon density region of the QCD phase diagram. The program will examine the energy region of interest from 7.7 to 19.6 GeV which is determined from the results of BES-I.     Some of the key measurements anticipated are: the net-protons kurtosis that could pinpoint the position of a critical point, the directed flow that might prove a softening of the EOS, and the chiral restoration in the dilepton channel. The measurements will be possible with the order of magnitude better statistics provided by the electron cooling upgrade of RHIC and with the detector upgrades planned to extend STAR's experimental reach. The upgrades are: the inner TPC sectors (iTPC), the Event Plane Detector (EPD), and the end-cap TOF (eTOF).     We will present upgrade details both on detectors and collider for BES-II. The operation plan for BES-II will be shown. The physics opportunities enabled by these upgrades will be discussed.

1183,Recent Borexino results and perspectives of the SOX measurement,"Borexino is  a liquid scintillator detector sited underground in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Italy). Its physics program, until the end of this year, is focussed on the study of solar neutrinos, in particular from the Beryllium, pp, pep and CNO fusion reactions. Knowing the reaction chains in the sun provides insights towards physics disciplines such as astrophysics (star physics, star formation, etc.), astroparticle and particle physics. Phase II started in 2011 and its aim is to improve the phase I results, in particular the measurements of the neutrino fluxes from the pep and CNO processes.    		    By the end of this year, data taking from the sun will be over and a new project is scheduled to launch: Short distance Oscillation with boreXino (SOX), which uses a Cerium source for neutrinos (100$\div$150 kCi of activity) and aims to confirm or rule out the presence of sterile neutrinos. This particle is hypothesised to justify the reactor, Gallium and LSND anomalies found and can reject extensions to the standard model.    		    The work presented is a summary of the solar neutrino results achieved so far, which lead not only to a precise study of the processes in the sun, but also to more Standard Model oriented measurements (such as the stability of the charge, i.e. the life time of the electron). Furthermore, the perspectives of the SOX program are discussed showing the experiment sensitivity to a fourth neutrino state covering almost entirely $3\sigma$ of the preferred region of the anomalous neutrino experiments, and additional applications of the detector such as the study of geo-neutrinos.",2017-08-29 06:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Future of Fundamental Physics,Workshop on Future of Fundamental Physics - Accelerators in HEP and beyond,Alessio Porcelli,
1186,Procedure for event characterization in Pb-Pb collisions at 40AGeV in the NA49 experiment at CERN SPS,"The time evolution of the strongly interacting matter created in a heavy-ion collision depends on the initial geometry and the collision centrality. This makes important the experimental determination of the collision geometry. In this presentation a procedure for event classification and estimation of the geometrical parameters in inelastic Pb-Pb collisions at the beam energy of 40 AGeV recorded with the fixed target experiment NA49 at CERN SPS is discussed. In the NA49 experiment, event classes can be defined using measured multiplicity of particles in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) or energy of spectators deposited in forward Veto or Ring calorimeters. Using the Monte-Carlo Glauber model, these event classes can be related to average values of the geometric quantities such as impact parameter or number of nucleon-nucleon collisions.The implementation of this procedure within a software framework of the future CBM experiment was adopted for event classification in the NA49 experiment. In the future, this procedure will be used for analysis of the new Pb-Pb data collected by the NA61/SHINE experiment and for comparison with the results previously obtained by STAR at RHIC and the NA49 at CERN SPS Collaborations.",2017-08-21 17:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Poster session,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Elisaveta Zherebtsova,
1187,Hot and dense nuclear matter in astrophysics,"An essential ingredient in the dynamical evolution of core-collapse supernovae and binary mergers of compact objects is the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter for densities up to 10 times the nuclear equilibrium density, temperatures up to 100 MeV, and lepton-to-baryon fractions in the range 0 to 0.6. Moreover, the EOS controls electron capture and neutrino emission rates and, therefore, it affects the conditions for nucleosynthesis and the cooling of protoneutron stars.    We discuss various approaches used in the construction of the EOS for use in simulations of the above astrophysical phenomena. After a brief survey of the constraints on the EOS from laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations, we address supranuclear densities where a uniform hadronic phase of matter resides. For the description of this phase both microscopic (e.g. Green's functions, variational, Brueckner-Hartree-Fock, chiral effective theory) as well as phenomenological (e.g. nonrelativistic potential models based on the Skyrme or the Gogny forces, relativistic mean-field theory, etc) techniques are employed. Finally, we review methods such as nuclear statistical equilibrium, the single-nucleus approximation, virial expansion, and molecular dynamics that are used in     the subnuclear regime where matter is a heterogeneous mixture of nucleons, nuclei, and other structures (collectively known as ""pasta"").",2017-08-29 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Constantinos Constantinou,

In this talk, we focus on the mathematical and physical consequences of such variations. One of the main problems we are confronted with is the characterization and classification of the density matrices of pure and mixed quantum states. It is known that the positivity of these operators is extremely sensitive to the value of Planck's constant h; the tiniest variation of h can lead to transitions from the classical to the quantum, and vice versa, or cause a pure state to become mixed. The involved problems, which belong to the area of ""quantum harmonic analysis"" on symplectic phase space, are notoriously difficult. We discuss this question having in mind the consequences it may have for the understanding of the early Universe.",2017-08-24 13:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Maurice de Gosson,

Inclusive jet, dijet and trijet cross sections are measured by the H1    collaboration in deep inelastic scattering, with virtualities of     the photon exchange between 5.5 and 15000 GeV$^2$. The data are    compared to NLO, approximative  NNLO and full NNLO QCD predictions.    The strong coupling constant is extracted at NNLO precision using the    inclusive jet and dijet data.    The production of prompt photons accompanied with jets is measured by    the ZEUS collaboration in deep-inelastic scattering. Cross sections are    studied differentially in several kinematics variables.    The azimuthal angle difference and the pseudorapidity     difference between the prompt photon and the leading jet is    particularly sensitive to possible higher order effects.    The cross sections are compared to two alternative theoretical models:    NLO QCD predictions based on collinear PDFs and the calculations using     $k_T$-factorization approach.",2017-08-24 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,A Particle Physics,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Radek Zlebcik,

While mainly developed to detect Cherenkov light, any visible light can be used to detect particles within the ice.    Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles predicted by many Beyond the Standard Model theories. They are carriers of a single elementary magnetic charge.    Different light production mechanisms dominate for this class of particle from direct Cherenkov light at highly relativistic velocities ($>0.76\,c$), indirect Cherenkov light at mildly relativistic velocities $\left(\approx 0.5\,c \textrm{ to } 0.76\,c \right)$, luminescence light at low relativistic velocities     $\left(\approx 0.1\,c \textrm{ to } 0.5\,c \right)$, as well as the propose proton decay at non relativistic velocities $\left(< \approx 0.1\,c \right)$.    For each of this speed ranges, searches for magnetic monopoles at the IceCube experiment are either in progress or already set competitive limits on the flux of magnetic monopoles. A summary of these searches will be presented, outlining already existing results as well as methods used by the currently conducted searches.",2017-08-18 09:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Mini-workshop on Highly Ionising Avatars of New Physics,Mini-workshop on Highly Ionising Avatars of New Physics,Frederik Lauber,https://indico.cern.ch/event/559774/contributions/2642037/attachments/1509190/2352781/icnfp.pdf
1191,Domain Walls in the Early Universe and Generation of Matter and Antimatter Domains,"We present a model where it is possible to generate cosmologically large domains of matter and antimatter separated by cosmologically large distances. Domain walls existed only in the early universe and later they disappeared. So the problem of domain walls in this model does not exist. These features are achieved through a postulated form of interaction between inflaton and a new scalar field.    This scenario inspired a study of the related problem - evolution of the domain wall width in expanding universe. According to classical results there is a region of parameter space where the solutions with constant physical width exist. Numerical study of the problem demonstrates that initial configurations tend to these solutions with time. However, we have found that the wall width can grow exponentially outside of that parameter region. These results are briefly discussed.",2017-08-29 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Special session on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity,Sergey Godunov,
1193,Experimental realization of a shortcut to adiabaticity by synthetic Aharonov-Bohm effect in a qutrit,"The adiabatic control of quantum systems has the advantage of robustness against experimental errors in pulse shape; however, to ensure the adiabaticity condition, the length of the pulses have to be rather long -  a disadvantage especially in solid-state qubits where the coherence time is still not too large.    Here we demonstrate a protocol of ""transitionless"" drive proposed by Berry, Demirplack, and Rice, which uses a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian to cancel the nonadiabatic terms. Building on our previous realization of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage [Nature Communications 7, 10628 (2016)], we employ a superconducting qutrit with the three levels coupled by single-photon and two-photon transitions. This configuration is analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and we will show how a gauge-invariant phase can be constructed and utilized experimentally. We also study in detail the robustness properties of this protocol.",2017-08-24 12:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Workshop on Quantum Foundations and Quantum Information,Sorin Paraoanu,

We discuss a special     renormalization procedure which happens to be different in finite and infinite domain cases. It is demonstrated that, as is typical for renormalization, a new dimensionfull parameter appears, having meaning of detector's recovery proper time. It plays no role at the leading order of perturbation theory but can be important non-perturbatively. We analyse the structure of finite time corrections to various observables. It is found that in large-time limit they can be described in a universal way, in a sense, and non-vanishing in adiabatic limit effects are of special interest. As an application, Landauer's principle interpretations for finite domain case are studied.",,20 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

One of the innovative topics to be investigated is the behaviour of the positron beam stored in a low emittance ring with a thin target, that is directly inserted in the ring chamber to produce muons.

1197,Fluctuations in non-ideal pion gas with dynamically fixed particle number,"We consider a non-ideal hot pion gas with the dynamically fixed number of particles in the model with the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction. The effective Lagrangian for the description of such a system is obtained after dropping the terms responsible for the change of the total particle number. Reactions $\pi^+\pi^-\leftrightarrow\pi^0\pi^0$, which determine the isospin balance of the medium, are permitted. Within the self-consistent Hartree approximation we compute the effective pion mass, thermodynamic characteristics of the system  and the variance of the particle number at temperatures above the critical point of the induced Bose-Einstein condensation when the pion chemical potential reaches the value of the effective pion mass. We analyze  conditions for the condensate formation in the process of thermalization of an initially non-equilibrium pion gas. The normalized variance of the particle number increases with a temperature decrease but  remains finite in the critical point of the Bose-Einstein condensation. This is due to the non-perturbative account of the interaction and is in contrast to the ideal-gas case. In the kinetic regime of the condensate formation the variance is shown to stay finite also.",2017-08-19 14:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,,Evgeni Kolomeitsev,
1198,Pion and kaon Bose-Einstein correlations from the BES program at STAR,"In high energy heavy-ion collisions, a hot and dense strongly    interacting system of deconfined quarks and gluons (sQGP) is created.    The Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC was performed to map the QCD    phase diagram. Model calculations suggest, in high energy collisions,    the transition from the hadronic matter to the deconfined state is a    smooth crossover, at lower energies, the phase transition could be first    order and there is a QCD critical point between the smooth cross-over    and the first order region. The correlation femtoscopy method allows one    to measure the space and time extent of the particle emitting source.    In this talk, we present preliminary results of the measurement of    like-sign two-pion and two-kaon correlations from the BES program at    STAR. Since kaons contain a strange quark and have smaller    cross-sections with the hot hadronic matter compared to pions, they may    provide additional information about the system evolution. The extracted    radius parameters of kaons are presented as a function of collision    centrality and transverse mass ($m_T$) and compared to those for pions.",2017-08-25 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Joined Session of Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC and Mini-workshop:Correlations and Fluctuations in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Grigory Nigmatkulov,

It is known, however, that several nonlocal models cannot reproduce the entire range of quantum mechanical correlations either. What is it then that distinguishes quantum nonlocality from the nonlocality of other potential theories? In this talk we will see that quantum nonlocality is unique in that it stems from a very moderate dismissal of local-realism. In particular, we will present three conditions that together fully characterize local realistic theories. Any pair of the conditions together lead to the set of quantum mechanical correlations. Any of the conditions alone implies that the correlations are ``quantum-like''. And if all conditions are violated, the theory enables stronger-than-quantum correlations.

Since then it was showed that    magnetic monopoles occur naturally in grand unified theories as    solutions of classical equations of motion.    The dedicated experiment can enjoy a new energy regime opened at the    LHC allowing direct probes of magnetic monopoles at the TeV scale for    the first time.    In this talk, recent results obtained with 13 TeV proton-proton    collision data at the MoEDAL experiments will be presented and    discussed. MoEDAL pioneered a technique in which monopoles would be    slowed down in a dedicated aluminium array and the presence of trapped    monopoles is probed by analysing the samples with a superconducting    magnetometer, obtaining the first LHC constraints for monopoles    carrying twice or thrice the Dirac charge.",2017-08-28 09:00:00+00:00,20 minutes,Talk,A Particle Physics,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Anthony Lionti,

1203,Latest results on diffraction at HERA,"Recent results on diffraction from the H1 and ZEUS experiments at HERA are presented. Measurement of open charm production in diffractive DIS has been performed by the H1 experiment using the event topology, given by ep→eXY, where the system X, containing at least one D*(2010) meson, is separated from a leading low-mass proton dissociative system Y by a large rapidity gap. The kinematics of D∗ candidates are fully reconstructed in the D∗→Kππ decay channel. The measured cross sections are compared at the level of stable hadrons with NLO QCD predictions obtained in the massive scheme, where the charm quark is produced via the boson-gluon fusion. The calculations rely on the collinear factorization theorem and are based on diffractive parton densities previously obtained by H1 from fits of the inclusive diffractive cross sections. The measured data are further used to estimate the ratio of diffractive to inclusive open charm production in deep inelastic scattering. The photoproduction of isolated photons is measured using diffractive events recorded by the ZEUS experiment. Cross sections are evaluated in the photon transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges 5 < EγT < 15 GeV and −0.7 < ηγ < 0.9, inclusively and with a jet with transverse-energy and pseudorapidity in the ranges 4 < EjetT < 35 GeV and −1.5 < ηjet < 1.8. A number of kinematic variables are studied and compared to predictions from the RAPGAP Monte Carlo model. In considering the fraction of the energy of the colourless (Pomeron) exchange that is transferred to the photon-jet final state, zP, it is found that the data lie above the RAPGAP predictions for zP > 0.9, giving evidence for direct-Pomeron interactions. The shapes of the kinematic distributions of events below and above this value of zP are separately well described by RAPGAP. This and other features provide evidence for a universal set of parton distribution functions in the Pomeron. The exclusive deep inelastic electroproduction and photoproduction of ψ(2S) and J/ψ(1S) has been studied by ZEUS. The cross-section ratio σ(ψ(2S))/σ(J/ψ(1S)) has been measured by ZUES as a function of Q2, W and t.

1204,Tripartite continuous-variables coherence and entanglement from vacuum fluctuations,"Vacuum fluctuations play a decisive role in many effects in quantum field theory and cosmology. When a parameter in the Lagrangian of the field is modulated by an external pump, vacuum fluctuations stimulate spontaneous downconversion processes, resulting in squeezing between modes symmetric with respect to half of the frequency of the pump. We have observed this phenomenon in the microwave domain, by using an array of SQUIDs with flux-bias tunable Josephson inductance, which creates a tunable speed of light along the array. We have extracted   the full 4 × 4 covariance matrix of the emitted microwave radiation, demonstrating that photons at frequencies symmetrical with respect to half of the modulation frequency are entangled [PNAS 110, 4234 (2013)]. Next, we have shown that by double parametric pumping of a superconducting microwave cavity, it is possible to generate another type of correlation, namely coherence between photons in separate frequency modes [Nature Communications 7, 12548 (2016)]. The coherence correlations are controllable by the phases of the pumps and are established by a quantum fluctuation that stimulates the simultaneous creation of two photon pairs. We have shown that the origin of this vacuum-induced coherence is the absence of which-way information in the frequency space. In this contribution I will also discuss the prospects of utilizing superconducting circuits for realizing analog relativistic and cosmological effects.",2017-08-22 09:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

Under these conditions, the online event selection is a very challenging task. In CMS, it is realized by a two-level trigger system: the Level-1 (L1) Trigger, implemented in custom-designed electronics, and the High Level Trigger (HLT), a streamlined version of the offline reconstruction software running on a computer farm.    In order to face this challenge, the L1 trigger has been through a major upgrade compared to Run 1, whereby all electronic boards of the system have been replaced, allowing more sophisticated algorithms to be run online. Its last stage, the global trigger, is now able to perform complex selections and to compute high-level quantities, like invariant masses. Likewise, the algorithms that run in the HLT go through big improvements; in particular, new approaches for the online track reconstruction lead to a drastic reduction of the computing time, and to much improved performances.

As member of the “Kernphysikalische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Hessen, KAH” he actively shaped the profile of GSI. Cold heavy-ion fusion proposed by Yuri Oganessian, theoretically supported by Walter Greiner, paved the way to the super heavy elements. We are happy that still during his lifetime we could prove some of his predictions      Experimental developments paving the way to super heavy elements were the cold fusion of heavy ions to create super heavy nuclei, separation in-flight, and the implantation of the separated nuclei into position sensitive surface-barrier detectors to observe the decay history of individual nuclei. With the discovery of oganesson, Z=118, the heaviest element known today, produced in hot fusion reaction using beams of 48Ca, we have come to the end of this series. New experimental ideas and development are needed and under way.      A primary challenge for SHE research is the  search for reactions to pass beyond oganesson and to explore the predicted island of superheavy elements. To measure cross-sections of femtobarns near and beyond Z=118, dedicated SHE factories are under construction. Reaction studies include new target-projectile combinations and transfer reactions. The next-generation of radioactive beam facilities will allow for large-scale studies. To which extent the use of rare-isotope beams can contribute to SHE research is under discussion.      The new SHE facilities include in-flight separators coupled to ion-catchers and multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometers with isobaric mass resolution. These allow the isotopic identification of single atomic nuclei, determining nuclear mass and charge. For the first time superheavy nuclei can be identified directly “still alive” independent from their decay mode. First promising results have already been obtained.",2017-08-18 10:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,W. Greiner Memorial Session,Walter Greiner Memorial session,Gottfried Münzenberg,
1214,Gigahertz quantum signatures compatible with telecommunication technologies,"Modern cryptography covers much more than encryption of messages in order to keep them secret. Many other cryptographic primitives exist, and it is important to consider how the security of these will be affected in a quantum future. Digital Signatures are a widely used cryptographic primitive, found eg. in e-mail, e-commerce and digital banking, and they form the basis for larger protocols. A signature $\sigma_m$ appended to a classical message $m$ ensures the authenticity and transferability of the message, whilst preventing forgery and repudiation. By employing quantum mechanics to distribute the $\sigma_m$ between recipients, unconditionally secure signature schemes can be constructed [1-4].    As the development of quantum security progresses, one must consider how to implement these schemes using currently existing technology.    To this end, we present a continuous-variable quantum signature scheme with an emphasis on compatibility with existing telecommunication technologies. Our scheme is information-theoretically secure against repudiation attacks and collective forging attacks, and can be implemented even when some QKD-based signature protocols fail. We note that this is the first implemented continuous-variable quantum signature scheme which does not require secure quantum channels between participants, although discrete-variable protocols have been proposed and implemented [5-6].    In the simplest scenario, quantum digital signature (QDS) schemes involve three parties: Alice, who wishes to sign $m$, and two recipients, Bob and Charlie. In a Distribution stage, Alice forms sequences of quantum states, $\rho_{B}^m$ and $\rho_C^m$, and sends them to Bob and Charlie, who measure the states and record their outcomes. The quantum states can be thought of as Alice's ``public key''. Her corresponding ``private key'', containing classical information about which states she sent, is used as the signature $\sigma_m$. Crucially, since a QDS scheme relies on quantum measurement, recipients gain only partial information about $\sigma_m$. Later, in an entirely classical Messaging stage Alice sends $\left(m, \sigma_m\right)$. Bob and Charlie compare $\sigma_m$ to their measurement results, and accept or reject $m$ accordingly.     We have implemented our scheme by distributing an alphabet of phase-modulated coherent states over a $20$~km optical fiber, and have devised the corresponding security proof. In particular, we prove that a dishonest forger who interacts with the quantum states cannot then declare some $\sigma'_m$ which will be accepted by honest recipients, except with negligible probability (security against forging). The probability of successful forgery is related to the smooth min-entropy, which can be interpreted as the uncertainty that an eavesdropper has about an honest participant's measurement outcomes [7]. Hence, by estimating a lower bound for the smooth min-entropy we prove security of our protocol, considering the finite-size effects intrinsic to signatures. As tighter bounds are developed these can readily be incorporated. Furthermore, Bob's and Charlie's measurement outcomes are symmetrised with respect to Alice, which makes it unlikely that a dishonest Alice can find some $\sigma''_m$ which Bob will accept but that she can later deny sending (security against repudiation).     Our system is built from telecom components running at a wavelength of $1553.33$~nm and is completely fiber-integrated. The coherent states are distributed by Alice at a rate of $10$~GHz and are measured using homodyne detection at Bob/Charlie. With our security proof the signature lengths are of the order of $10^6$ to sign $m$ with a $0.01\%$ chance of failure, meaning a $1$~bit message can be signed in $0.1$~ms. This opens the possibility of efficiently distributing quantum signatures on a large scale with minimal installation cost, and makes our scheme competitive in a landscape where both practicality and security are important.

The observed data is consistent with the expectation from the standard model. The results are interpreted in terms of pair production of charginos and neutralinos with nearly degenerate masses, as expected in natural compressed higgsino models, and in terms of the pair production of top squarks for the case that the neutralino and the top squark have similar masses. The mass region excluded was so far constrained only by LEP experiments.

1220,Would Nega-Particles Prove to be Essential Ingredients of Quantum Reality?,"The alleged wave-function collapse becomes especially intriguing when detection does not occur (IFM), nevertheless exerting causal, even nonlocal effects. How can a non-event be causally equivalent to an actual one? Our answer is based of two recent advances. i) Quantum Oblivion [1-4] is a basic quantum interaction recently discovered, showing that even non-events are events which very briefly occur and then “unoccur” prior to the final macroscopic collapse. ii) The Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF) [5] renders the quantum interaction a combination of two wave-functions going along both time directions. A recent prediction [6,7] of this formalism, verifiable with ordinary quantum measurements, obliges the disappearance and reappearance of a particle under special conditions. The former occurs when the particle and its counterpart, possessing negative mass (nega-particle) occupy the same spacetime region, while the latter follows when they are apart again. These two lines of investigation suggest a simple and natural account of many quantum phenomena.    References    [1] A.C. Elitzur, E. Cohen, Int. J. Quantum Inf. 12, 1560024 (2015).    [2] E.

1222,From Quantum-Limited Measurements towards Quantum Squeezing Detection over Satellite Links,"Quantum optics allows implementing cryptographic protocols that are verifiably immune against any conceivable attack. Standard telecommunication components allow for an efficient implementation of quantum communication using continuous-variables (CV) of light. At MPL, we routinely implement CV quantum communication based on phase-shift keying of coherent states in combination with homodyne detection [1,2].     Existing fiber infrastructure is not suitable for long-haul links between metropolitan networks since classical telecom repeaters cannot relay quantum states. A space borne Laser Communication Terminal (LCT), however, would be capable to relay quantum key distribution (QKD) between a large number of hubs on ground. To this end, we demonstrated quantum-limited measurements of signals from the Alphasat satellite in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) [3]. Our results underpin the feasibility of satellite quantum communication based on existing technology.     On the fundamental research side, the large gravitational potential difference between GEO and ground offers an ideal testbed to investigate gravitational effects on quantum states.    Our measurements from the Alphasat satellite showed that atmospheric noise can be overcome and that merely the huge diffraction losses pose challenges for the detection of quantum properties such as quantum squeezing.     For homodyne detectors in classical telecommunication, the precise measurement value of the continuous quadrature observable is of minor significance. The signals in BPSK encoding, for instance, are discriminated based on the sign of the measurement outcome, such that the signals are often projected onto their sign bit thereby precluding the access to the continuous quadrature spectrum. We investigate the implications of this extremal discretization with regard to the detection of quantum squeezing and find that it can still be witnessed efficiently [4].     [1] B.

1223,Probing the Origin of the Proton Spin at STAR,"The STAR Collaboration at RHIC is exploring the partonic origin of the proton spin with a broad range of measurements in polarized $pp$ collisions.  STAR measurements of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, for inclusive jet production in $pp$ collisions at 200 GeV provide the first clear evidence that the gluons in the proton with $x > 0.05$ are polarized.  Recent follow-up studies include measurements of $A_{LL}$ for inclusive jets in 510 GeV $pp$ collisions, which push the sensitivity to gluon polarization down to $x \sim 0.02$, and measurements of $A_{LL}$ for di-jet production at 200 and 510 GeV, which provide more precise information regarding the shape of $x\Delta g(x)$.  STAR measurements of the transverse single-spin asymmetry, $A_N$, for $W$ boson production provide the first experimental investigation of the non-universality of the Sivers function.  Precise follow-up measurements of $A_N$ for direct photon production, Drell-Yan di-electron production, and $W$ boson production are underway that will both provide a definitive test of the non-universality and constrain evolution of transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) over a very wide $Q^2$ range.  STAR measurements of interference fragmentation functions and the transverse single-spin dependence of the azimuthal modulation of pions in jets provide the first observations of transversity in $pp$ collisions.  The results enable tests of universality and factorization-breaking effects for TMDs in hadronic interactions.  Additional transverse modulations provide limits on gluon linear polarization and the twist-3 analog of the gluon Sivers distribution.  The current status of these analyses and the prospects to extend them in the near future will be discussed.",2017-08-24 05:50:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,A Particle Physics,,Carl Gagliardi,
1225,Fundamental mechanism of the quantum computational speedup,"A paradigmatic example of quantum computational speedup is the simplest instance of the quantum algorithm devised by Grover. Bob, the problem setter, hides a ball in one of four drawers. Alice, the problem solver, is to locate it by opening drawers. In the classical case, Alice needs to open up to three drawers, always one in the quantum case.            The drawer and ball problem is an example of oracle problem. The operation of checking whether the ball is in a drawer is an example of function evaluation. In the case of oracle problems, the quantum speedup comes from comparing the number of function evaluations required to solve the problem quantumly and classically. It should be noted that each speedup has been found by means of ingenuity. Outside the present unconventional approach, there is no fundamental explanation of the speedup, no unification of the various speedups, no way of foreseeing the number of function evaluations needed to solve a generic oracle problem in an optimal quantum way.          We note that the usual representation of quantum algorithms, limited to the input-output transformation typical of computation, is physically incomplete. Alice works on a quantum register *A* initially in a sharp state unrelated to the problem to be solved. By performing function evaluations interleaved with other unitary transformations, she sends this initial state into an output state that encodes the solution of the problem. Then she acquires the solution by measuring the content of *A*. The problem setting is not represented physically, namely by a quantum state – it is implicit in the mathematics of function evaluation. Furthermore, the complete representation of a quantum process must include the initial measurement, the unitary transformation of the state after measurement, and the final measurement.         We show that just completing the representation of quantum algorithms explains their speedup. This is done in three steps.         First, we extend the usual representation to the process of setting the problem. We add a possibly imaginary quantum register *B* meant to contain the problem setting – e. g.the number of the drawer with the ball. We assume that initially this register is in a uniform quantum superposition of all the possible problem settings. The initial state of register *A* is as before. An initial measurement of the content of *B* selects a problem setting at random. Ordinarily, Bob would unitarily send it into the desired setting; we jump this transformation for simplicity. Alice unitarily sends the random outcome of the initial measurement into an output state where register *B* still contains the problem setting selected by Bob and register *A* the corresponding solution. Then she acquires the solution by measuring the content of *A*. In view of what will follow, we note that this measurement leaves the quantum state unaltered; there is thus a unitary transformation *U* between the initial and final measurement outcomes.    Second. The extended representation works for Bob and any external observer, it does not for Alice. The input state of the representation (the outcome of the initial measurement), where register *B* is in a sharp state, would tell her the setting and thus the solution of the problem before she performs any function evaluation. To her, this setting must be hidden inside the black box that performs the function evaluations. We obtain Alice’s view of the extended representation by postponing at the end of her problem-solving action the projection of the quantum state associated with the initial measurement. As well known, this kind of projection can be postponed at will along a unitary transformation that follows the measurement; furthermore, the content of register *B* and that of register *A* are commuting observables, so that the projection in question can be postponed after the final Alice’s measurement. In particular, the input state of the quantum algorithm to Alice becomes one of complete ignorance of the problem setting selected by Bob. Now the unitary part of Alice’s action yields a superposition of tensor products, each a possible problem settings multiplied by the corresponding solution. The final Alice’s measurement of the content of *A* projects the superposition in question on the product of the problem setting selected by Bob and the corresponding solution. This particular projection is unforeseeable to Alice as usual, it is already known to Bob and any external observer.      Third, we physically represent the reversibility of the computation process between the initial and final measurement outcomes by symmetrizing it for time reversal. This is done by assuming that the initial and final measurements, in presence of one another (contextually), reduce to partial measurements that evenly and without redundancy contribute to the selection of the problem setting and the solution, in all the possible ways in quantum superposition. The selection performed by the initial partial measurement should be propagated forward in time by *U*; that performed by the final one backward in time by the inverse of *U*. We note that any uneven sharing would introduce a preferred direction of time unjustified in the present reversible context. This symmetrization leaves the representation to Bob and any external observer unaltered and changes that to Alice. It projects the former input state to her, of complete ignorance of the problem setting and thus of the solution, on a state where she knows half of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will read in the future. Hiding to Alice the information coming to her from the initial measurement highlights the information coming to her from the final measurement.    An optimal quantum algorithm turns out to be a sum over classical histories in each of which Alice knows in advance one of the possible halves of the solution and performs the function evaluations necessary to identify the missing half. This quantitatively explains the quantum speedup and allows to predict the number of function evaluations required to solve a generic oracle problem in an optimal quantum way.

1233,Ultra long-lived particles searches with MATHUSLA,"Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) include particles that are neutral, weakly coupled, and long-lived that can decay to final states containing several hadronic jets. Long-lived particles (LLPs) can be detected as displaced decays from the interaction point, or missing energy if they escape. ATLAS and CMS have performed searches at the LHC and significant exclusion limits have been set in recent years.    However, the current searches performed at colliders have limitations. An LLP does not interact with the detector and it is only visible once it decays. Unfortunately, no existing or proposed search strategy will be able to observe the decay of non-hadronic electrically neutral LLPs with masses above ~ GeV and lifetimes near the limit set by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (cτ ~ 107-108 m). Therefore, ultra-long-lived particles (ULLPs) produced at the LHC will escape the main detector with extremely high probability.    In this talk we describe the concept of the MATHUSLA surface detector (MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra Stable neutraL pArticles), which can be implemented with existing technology and in time for the high luminosity LHC upgrade to find such ultra-long-lived particles, whether produced in exotic Higgs decays or more general production modes. The MATHUSLA detector will consist of resistive plate chambers (RPC) and scintillators with a total sensitive area of 200x200 m square. It will be installed on the surface, close to the ATLAS or CMS detectors.    A small-scale test detector (~ 6 m square) will be installed on the surface above ATLAS in early summer 2017.

1234,Non-linear effect of the fluctuation for the inhomogeneous chiral phase transition,"We discuss the non-linear effects of the fluctuation in the chiral-restored phase just before the inhomogeneous chiral phase transition. The fluctuations consist of quark-antiquark and quark particle-hole excitations, and included by the random phase approximation within the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.    The particular roles of thermal and quantum fluctuations can be understood systematically. The fluctuations give rise to the first order phase transition from the chiral-restored phase to the inhomogeneous chiral phase while the phase transition is the second order one within the mean field approximation. The change can be discussed regardless of the type of the inhomogeneous condensate and the effect of the thermal fluctuation is more crucial than the quantum one.    In addition, it is argued that anomalous behavior of the thermodynamic quantities due to the fluctuation should have phenomenological implications for the inhomogeneous chiral transition. Some common features for other phase transitions, such as those from the normal to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in superconductivity, are also emphasized.",2017-08-18 15:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Poster,Special Session on QCD,,Ryo Yoshiike,
1236,Non-exponential decay in a quantum field theoretical treatment,"It is nowadays theoretically understood that in Quantum Mechanics (QM) the exponential decay is only an approximation. Deviations have been experimentally measured both at short and at long times. In turn, the non-exponential decay is responsible of the (also measured) Quantum Zeno Effect. Yet, an interesting open question, presented in this talk, is the emergence of non-exponential decay in the context of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT). Namely, this is the correct environment for creation and annihilation of particles. By using standard QFT techniques, we aim to evaluate the short-time behavior in a straightforward calculation. We shall find that non-exponential decay is also present in each QFT but is typically very small. An interesting exception is that of superrenormalizable theory, where deviations can be more sizable.",2017-08-23 14:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,"C Quantum Physics, Quantum Optics and Quantum Information",Francesco Giacosa,
1237,Excited vector mesons: phenomenology and predictions for a yet unknown vector $\bar{s}s$ state with a mass of about 1.93 GeV,"The firm understanding of standard quark-antiquark states (including excited states) is necessary to perform search of non-conventional mesons with the same quantum numbers. In this talk, we study the phenomenology of two nonets of excited vector mesons, which predominantly correspond to radially excited vector mesons with quantum numbers $n \hspace{0.15cm} ^{2s+1}L_{J} = 2 ^{3}S_{1}$ and to orbital excited vector mesons characterised by quantum numbers $n \hspace{0.15cm} ^{2s+1}L_{J} = 1 ^{3}D_{1}$. We evaluate the decays of these mesons into two pseudoscalar mesons and into a pseudoscalar and ground-state vector meson by making use of a relativistic quantum field theoretical model which based on flavor symmetry. Moreover, we also study the radiative decays into a photon and a pseudoscalar mesons by using vector meson dominance. We shall compare our results to the PDG and comment on open issues concerning the corresponding measured resonances. Within our approach, we are also able to make predictions for a not-yet discovered $\bar{s}s$ state in $n \hspace{0.15cm} ^{2s+1}L_{J} = 1 ^{3}D_{1}$ nonet which has the mass of about 1.93 GeV.

We use a data set of 5.46 $fb^{-1}$ collected by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron collider during Run II using a dedicated trigger path which required a displaced vertex compatible with a b-hadron decay. A data-driven procedure is applied to estimate the dijet mass spectrum of the non-resonant multijet background.

1246,Equations of anisotropic hydrodynamics for quark and gluon fluids,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has been a fundamental tool to understand the evolution of matter in heavy-ion experiments at RICH and LHC. Despite the success of second order viscous hydrodynamics in reproducing collective behavior and particle spectra, there are still theoretical shortcomings that may question the validity of the approach in heavy-ion experiments conditions. Large gradients and fast longitudinal expansion produce very large pressure corrections, in contrast to the founding hypothesis of small deviation from local equilibrium and the perturbative treatment viscous corrections. One way to address this problem is anisotropic hydrodynamics. Most of the theoretical investigations about hydrodynamics started from a kinetic underlying substrate of a single species of particles. Unfortunately the striking agreement of anisotropic hydrodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation was not preserved in the case of a mixtures of quarks and gluons.    We recently extended the anisotropic hydrodynamics prescription for massless particles in 1+1-dimensions to the case of mixtures of fluids, largely improving the agreement with the exact solutions compared to previous works [1-3]. We allow quarks and gluons to have different momentum scales during the evolution and a non vanishing baryon chemical potential. We take the dynamical equations from the zeroth, the first and the second moment of the Boltzmann equation [4]. We performed a test of the new formulation, comparing the results of anisotropic hydorodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation for a mixture of fluid in the Bjorken flow limit, finding a very good agreement [5-6].

1250,Finally making sense of the double-slit experiment,"We put forth a time-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics that does not stem from the wave properties of the particle. Rather, it posits corpuscular properties along with nonlocal properties, all of which are deterministic. This change of perspective points to deterministic properties in the Heisenberg picture as primitive instead of the wave function, which remains an ensemble property. This way, within a double-slit experiment, the particle goes only through one of the slits. In addition, a nonlocal property originating from the other distant slit has been affected through the Heisenberg equations of motion. Under the assumption of nonlocality, uncertainty turns out to be crucial to preserve causality. Hence, a (qualitative) uncertainty principle can be derived rather than assumed.

1252,Predictability analysis of α decay formulae and the α partial half-lives of exotic nuclei.,"α decay is one of the main decay modes of Super-heavy nuclei (SHN) and highly neutron deficient medium-mass nuclei, collectively termed `exotic´ nuclei. In the synthesis of such nuclei and the radiochemical characterization of their longer-lived decay products, the identification is aided by the theoretical predictions of α decay half-lives (T1/2) and decay energies. We examine the ability of 3 phenomenological alpha decay formulae, the Generalised Liquid Drop Model (GLDM), the Sobiczewski-Parkhomenko and the Viola-Seaborg formulae, to predict the α partial T1/2 of 100 exotic nuclei by the statistical quantification of their accuracy and precision. These quantities were derived using a method based on standard experimental benchmarking wherein the α spectroscopic data of 302 well-established alpha decaying nuclei (calibration data set) were used. Experimental masses as well as Finite Range Droplet Model masses were used to compute Qα. Improved coefficients for the three formulae were derived resulting in modified formulae. A simple linear optimization allowed adjustment of the modified formulae for the insufficient statistics of the odd-even and odd-odd decays of the calibration data set, without changing the modified formulae. Relatively better figures of merit for the odd-odd and the SHN were obtained using the modified GLDM formula.",2017-08-19 14:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,W.

1254,Relativistic and Device Independent Verifiable Quantum Computation,"As quantum technologies develop the question of verifying/certifying the correctness of the quantum devices is crucial. In particular, as quantum computers will outperform classical, it may be impossible to test the correctness of the quantum computer using a classical. Instead, one need to perform verifiable quantum computation (VBQC). A number of such protocols exist, and we focus on protocols that exploit blind quantum computation (e.g. Fitzsimons, Kashefi 2012). For those protocols the (honest) parties need to trust their devices. We developed a protocol that is device independent (Gheorghiu, Kashefi, Wallden 2015), however that protocol similarly to other works (e.g. Reichardt, Unger, Vazirani 2012) impose an unphysical assumption of no-communication between parties that cannot be enforced using spacelike separation. In this contribution we develop a protocol that avoids this problem by first formulating the VBQC in a ""step-wise"" form and then giving a truly device-independent protocol where the no-communication of the parties is enforced from relativistic constraints.",2017-08-21 14:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

We then construct a 'product spectral triple' from the corresponding family of canonical spectral triples over M and the lapse function. This product spectral triple reproduces the canonical spectral triple of the product manifold equipped with the 'Wick rotated' Riemannian metric. The canonical Lorentzian Dirac operator can then be obtained as a 'reverse Wick rotation' of the Riemannian Dirac operator obtained from our product construction.     For the noncommutative scenario, we show that the construction of the product spectral triple also works in the case of a family of abstract spectral triples parametrised by the real line.

1272,Gaussian intrinsic entanglement,"Entanglement measures proved to be a vital tool for     development of quantum information science. For example, an important     property of entanglement called monogamy is quantitative, and therefore     cannot be captured without introducing entanglement measures.     Additionally, entanglement measures provide useful bounds on several     important hardly computable quantities, and they are indispensable in     proofs of some quantum-information no-go theorems. In experiment,     entanglement measures are needed to assess the quality of prepared     entangled states and entangling gates, and they set bounds one has to     surpass to demonstrate some crucial quantum protocols such as     entanglement distillation.    A common feature of a vast majority of currently used entanglement     measures is that either they possess a good physical meaning or are     computable but not both. We probe the gap between computable and     physically meaningful entanglement measures by introducing a new     quantifier of entanglement which we call intrinsic entanglement     (IE) [1,2]. The proposed quantity is a modification of the so called     classical measure of entanglement [3], which is obtained by maximin     optimization of intrinsic information [4] giving an upper bound on the     secret-key rate in the classical secret key agreement protocol [5].     We investigate the IE within the framework of an important class     of Gaussian states, operations, and measurements. We show, that in     the Gaussian scenario IE simplifies to the mutual information of a     Gaussian distribution of outcomes of measurements on parts of the system,     conditioned on the outcomes of a measurement on a purifying subsystem,     which is first minimized with respect to measurements on the purifying     part and subsequently maximized over the remaining measurements. It is     further demonstrated that the Gaussian intrinsic entanglement     (GIE) vanishes only on separable states and it exhibits monotonicity under     Gaussian local trace-preserving operations and classical communication.     Finally, in the case of two-mode states we compute GIE for all pure states,     all symmetric states with a three-mode purification, asymmetric squeezed     thermal states with a three-mode purification and restricted local noises, as     well as for symmetric squeezed thermal states with a four-mode purification     and restricted local noises. Surprisingly, in all of these cases, GIE is     equal to Gaussian Rényi-2 entanglement [6], which leads us to a conjecture     that the two quantities are equal on all Gaussian states. As GIE is     operationally associated to the secret-key agreement protocol and can     be computed for several important classes of states, it offers a compromise     between computable and physically meaningful entanglement quantifiers.

1273,Directional dark matter search with nuclear emulsion,"Direct dark matter searches are promising techniques to identify the nature of dark matter particles. A variety of experiments have been developed over the past decades, aiming to detect Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) via their scattering in a detector medium. Exploiting directionality would also give a proof of the galactic origin of dark matter making it possible to have a clear and unambiguous signal to background separation. The directional detection of Dark Matter requires very sensitive experiment combined with highly performant technology. The NEWSdm experiment, based on nuclear emulsions, is proposed to measure the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils. We discuss the potentiality, both in terms of exclusion limits and potential discovery, of a directional experiment based on the use of a solid target made by newly developed nuclear emulsions and read-out systems reaching sub-micrometric resolution.",2017-08-21 14:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special Session on Instruments and Methods in HEP,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Murat Ali Guler,
1274,Squeezed light enhanced sensing of a micro-mechanical oscillator,"Ultra-precise measurements of various parameters such as the mass of nano-particles, magnetic fields or gravity can be attained by probing the phononic modes of a micro-mechanical oscillator with light. The sensitivity of such measurements is in part governed by the noise of the phononic mode as well as the noise of the probing light mode, so by decreasing the noise of the probe beam an enhanced sensitivity can be expected. We demonstrate this effect by using squeezed states of light where the quantum uncertainty of the relevant quadrature is reduced below the shot noise level. Using this squeezing-enhanced sensitivity effect, we demonstrate 1) improved feedback cooling of a phononic mode in a microtoroidal cavity and 2) improved sensing of a magnetic field using the coupling to a microtoroidal phononic mode via a magnetorestrictive material. We present our recent experimental results and discuss future directions.",2017-08-21 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

1275,Introduction to noncommutative digital geometry,"Noncommutative geometry, as the generalised notion of geometry, allows us to model the quantum gravity effects in an effective description without full knowledge of quantum gravity itself. On a curved space one must use the methods of Riemannian geometry – but in their quantum version, including quantum differentials, quantum metrics and quantum connections – constituting quantum geometry. The mathematical framework behind it is the noncommutative differential graded algebra. After presenting the motivation and the general framework, I will discuss some recent results on the classification of noncommutative differential geometries, over the finite field F2 (instead that of C), in n = 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The choice of the finite field proposes a new kind of 'discretisation scheme', which we called the 'digital geometry'.",2017-08-24 12:00:00+00:00,40 minutes,Talk,Workshop on NCG,Workshop on Noncommutative Geometry at the Forefront of Physics,Anna Pachol,
1276,Isospin dynamics in nuclear structure,"I will discuss relativistic nuclear field theory (RNFT) as a novel approach to the nuclear many-body problem, which is based on QHD meson-nucleon Lagrangian and relativistic field theory.  RNFT connects consistently the high-energy scale of heavy mesons, the medium-energy range of pion, and the low-energy domain of emergent collective vibrations (phonons) [1]. Mesons and phonons build up the effective interaction in various channels, in particular, the phonon-exchange part takes care of the retardation effects, which are of great importance for the fragmentation of single-particle states, spreading of collective giant resonances and soft modes, quenching and beta-decay rates with significant consequences for astrophysics and theory of weak processes in nuclei.         Over the past decade, RNFT has demonstrated a very good performance in various nuclear structure calculations across the nuclear chart [1,2-4]. Recent progress on the response theory in the proton-neutron channel [5] has allowed a very good description of spin-isospin-flip excitations, which are formed predominantly by pions coupled to proton-neutron configurations in nuclear medium. Such excitations as, for instance, Gamow-Teller and spin-dipole resonances in medium-mass nuclei are of a high astrophysical importance as they are in the direct relation to beta-decay and electron capture rates. More exotic isospin-flip excitations studied lately at NSCL facility have been described very well by RNFT [6]. Presently, excitation modes in the deuteron transfer channel are considered in view of their role in mediating the isoscalar pairing and discussed as constraints for the delta-meson contribution to the nuclear forces [7].

It represents a reorganisation of the physical information of the theory with the advantage of maintaining manifest gauge invariance and simplifying the calculation of scattering amplitudes.     I will describe recent advances in the worldline approach to non-Abelian field theory, explaining how the coupling to the gauge field can be incorporated into the worldline action by introducing auxiliary ""colour"" fields. I will show how these colour fields generate Wilson loop interactions and how a novel Chern-Simons term provides a projection onto an irreducible representation of the gauge group. The calculational efficiency of the worldline formalism is preserved by extending a worldline supersymmetry to the include the colour fields. Finally I will sketch a similar approach to pure Yang-Mills theory and some ongoing work on fields in non-commutative space-time with U(N) symmetry.",2017-08-18 13:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Special Session on QCD,Special session on QCD - from vacuum to finite temperatures,James Edwards,

1282,Experimental Relativistic Quantum Information with a Geostationary Satellite,"With quantum science in space we reach a regime of physics, where the interplay between general relativity and quantum theory is unclear. A contemporary experimental scenario is satellite-based quantum communication, where an investigation of the impact of gravitational effects is of both, fundamental and technological interest. Specifically, quantum field theory in curved space-time (or relativistic quantum information) is used to describe the aforementioned scenario, while experimental evidence for the predictions are not existing yet [1]. However, the rapid development of quantum technologies in space necessitates a thorough experimental investigation of the relevant physics [2, 3]. Therefore, we investigate potential realization of relativistic quantum information experiments, based on a space-to-ground quantum communication link with a satellite in the geostationary Earth orbit [4]. Thereby, we aim to complement quantum field theory in curved space-time with experimental evidence and to explore possible limitations of satellite-based quantum communication.    [1] R.

Using the compact diquark-antidiquark configuration, we calculate the mass spectra of these tetraquark states. There are 18 hidden-charm $cc\bar c\bar c$ tetraquark currents with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$, $0^{-+}$, $0^{--}$, $1^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, $1^{-+}$, $1^{--}$, and $2^{++}$. We use them to perform QCD sum rule analyses, and the obtained masses are all higher than the spontaneous dissociation thresholds of two charmonium mesons, which are thus their dominant decay modes. The masses of the corresponding hidden-bottom $bb\bar b\bar b$ tetraquarks are all below or very close to the thresholds of the $\Upsilon(1S)\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\eta_b(1S)\eta_b(1S)$, except one current of $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. Hence, we suggest to search for the doubly hidden-charm states in the $J/\psi J/\psi$ and $\eta_c(1S)\eta_c(1S)$ channels.",2017-08-23 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Wei Chen,

We explored the noncommutative causal structure of several toy models as almost commutative spacetimes and Moyal-Weyl spacetime. From those models, we discovered some unexpected physical interpretations as a geometrical explanation of the ‘Zitterbewegung' trembling motion of a fermion and geometrical constraints on translations and energy jumps of wave packets on Moyal spacetime.",2017-08-24 09:20:00+00:00,40 minutes,Talk,Workshop on NCG,Workshop on Noncommutative Geometry at the Forefront of Physics,Nicolas Franco,
1300,Separate freeze-out of strange particles and the quark-hadron phase transition,"The scenario with the independent chemical freeze-outs of stange and non-strange particles     is presented. Within such a scenario an apparent non-equilibration of strangeness is naturaly     explained by a separation of freeze-outs of stange and non-strange hadrons, which, nevertheless,     are connected by the conservation laws of entropy, baryonic charge and third isospin projection.    An interplay between the separate freeze-out of strangeness and its residual non-equilibration      is studied within an elaborate version of the hadron resonance gas model.     The developed model enables us to perform a high-quality fit of the hadron multiplicity ratios     measured at AGS, SPS and RHIC with an overall fit quality $\chi^2/dof=0.93$. A special attention     is paid to a description of the Strangeness Horn and to the well-known problem of selective suppression of     $\Lambda^-$ and $\Xi$ hyperons. It is remarkable that, for all collision energies, the     strangeness non-equilibrtion factor $\gamma_s$ is about 1 within the error bars. The only     exception is found in the vicinity of the center-of-mass collision energy 7.6 GeV, at which a    20% enhancement of strangeness is observed. Our previus results about the existence of strong jumps of     the chemical freeze-out pressure, temperature and effective number of degrees found at the center-of-mass    collision energy from 4.3 to 4.9 GeV are also confirmed. The arguments in  favor of an exceptional    role of these irregularities as the signals of the quark-gluon-hadron mixed phase formation at this    energies are given.",2017-08-24 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Oleksii Ivanytskyi,
1301,Probing the tricritical endpoint of QCD phase diagram at NICA-FAIR energies,"In this talk I present several remarkable irregularities at chemical    freeze-out which are found using an advanced version of the hadron    resonance gas model. The most prominent of them are the sharp peaks of the    trace anomaly and baryonic charge density existing at chemical freeze-out    at the center-of-mass energies 4.9 GeV and 9.2 GeV. They are accompanied    by two sets of highly correlated quasi-plateaus in the collision energy    dependence of the entropy per baryon, total pion number per baryon, and    thermal pion number per baryon which are found at the center-of-mass    energies 3.8–4.9 GeV and 7.6–9.2 GeV. The low-energy set of quasi-plateaus    was predicted a long time ago. On the basis of the generalized    shock-adiabat model I show that the low-energy correlated quasi-plateaus    give evidence for the anomalous thermodynamic properties inside the mixed    phase found at the center-of-mass energies 4.3–4.9 GeV. Furthermore, I    would like to discuss the thermostatic properties of the mixed phase and    the ones of an exponential mass spectrum of hadrons and to present the    practical conclusions for the chemical equilibration of strangeness in    heavy ion collisions. Using the similarity of low- and high-energy    irregularities I argue that the high-energy correlated quasi-plateaus may    correspond to a second phase transition.  Its possible origin and a    possible location of the tricritical endpoint of QCD matter phase diagram    are also discussed.",2017-08-24 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC,Kyrill Bugaev,

1327,Learning about A Level Physics students’ understandings of particle physics using concept mapping,"This talk describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A Level students’ understandings of particle physics, a paper about which was published in Physics Education (52). Fifty-nine Year 12 (16- and 17-year-old) students from two London schools participated. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were instructed how to make a concept map and were provided with 24 topic-specific key words. Students’ concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions they represented, enumerating how many students had made each one, and by identifying errors and potential misconceptions, referring to the examination specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by most of the students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although there was evidence that some students were unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton.  However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons.  Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks.",2017-08-22 13:55:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Session on Physics Education  and Outreach,,Helen Gourlay,

It is defined as the last Friday of every September, it runs at University, Research Center Campuses and other well established public places and it deploys many innovative and imaginative methodologies to invite the public of all ages to attend and enjoy the event. This year is the 12th year of the European Researchers' Night event and as usual it will take place in more than 300 cities in Europe. In this presentation, we will discuss the concepts of this renowned Night in Europe and we will present our experience of RENA, a Greek consortium of Research and Educational establishments, with the activities and measured impact of the European Researchers' Night.",2017-08-22 13:30:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Session on Physics Education  and Outreach,,Georgios Fanourakis,
1329,Physics perspectives of PANDA at FAIR,"The non-perturbative nature of the strong interaction leads to spectacular phenomena, such as the formation of hadronic matter, color confinement, and the generation of the mass of visible matter. To get deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms remains one of the most challenging tasks within the field of subatomic physics.The antiProton ANnihilations at DArmstadt (PANDA) collaboration has the ambition to address key questions in this field by exploiting a cooled beam of antiprotons at the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR) at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) combined with a state-of-the-art and versatile detector.

1331,Amplitude analysis of the exotic states,"In the talk, I examine the issues of the amplitude analysis related to the exotic states.      A building of the cascade decay amplitude becomes a non-trivial problem especially in the presence of the spin of particles in the final state.    We compare the helicity amplitudes and the amplitudes in the tensor formalism considering singularities and the crossing properties.      An interpretation of results of the partial wave analysis is often ambiguous. A picture of the sequential two-body decays is spoiled by the rescattering processes.    I will demonstrate an example of $a_1(1420)$ phenomenon observed in the $J^{PC} = 1^{++}\,f_0\pi\,P$-wave by COMPASS experiment.

However, multimode entangled states are generally constructed by targeting a specific entanglement configuration. This yields to a fixed experimental setup that therefore exhibits reduced versatility and scalability. Here we demonstrate a reconfigurable highly multimode entangled state generated by parametric down conversion of a mode locked laser source. Without altering either the initial squeezing source or the experimental architecture, we realize the construction of many cluster states of various sizes and connectivities. More generally we show that this system enables the complete characterization of quantum correlations and fluctuations for any multimode Gaussian state. Progress in the direction of non-gaussian multimode states will be also reported.",2017-08-22 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on continuous variables and quantum information,Workshop on Cont.

It seems that the more we learn about them, the more they defy understanding. Basic properties of the $X(3872)$, including its natural width and whether its mass is above or below the ($m_{D^0} + m_{D^{*0}}$) threshold, are still not known. Likewise $X(3915)$ $J^{PC}$ determination, for its production in $B\to KX(3915)$; $X(3915)\to J/\psi\omega$ decays and in $\gamma\gamma\to J/\psi\omega$ collisions, as well as observations (or stringent limits) on decays to other final states, such as $\eta\eta_c$ and $D\bar{D}$, are needed.

Cosmic rays have been bombarding the Earth constantly since the planet formed and if monopoles have been created, then they may be deposited in terrestrial samples of material.  I will discuss the feasibility for monopole searches that could use ice core samples from climatology studies to complement sample studies that have been performed previously using other material samples such as rocks or water.  This would complement the existing searches for exotic particles at MoEDAL and the LHC general-purpose detectors.

1378,Prospects for Exotic Hadron Spectroscopy at PANDA,"A new Facility for Antiproton an Ion Research (FAIR) is being build at GSI in Darmstadt, where PANDA (antiProton Annihilations at Darmstadt) will be one of the key experiments. The versatile PANDA detector together with the usage of an intense and high quality antiproton beam provides a unique environment to study the formation of hadrons and the dynamics of color confinement. As the fundamental theory of strong interactions, QCD allows a large variety of color-singlet states, thereby predicting the existence of hadrons that differ from baryons and mesons. The field of hadron physics has been intensively studied for quite a long time to predict these exotic, non-conventional forms of matter and identify them experimentally. However the agreement is not yet satisfactory, since many predictions lack in experimental evidences, and many of the recent observations in the charmonium region either were unexpected or have unexpected properties. The unique features of PANDA provide complementary tools to address the properties of recently discovered exotic candidates and to probe regimes that have not been explored yet. In this talk, I will address the unique features of PANDA and discuss a few feasibility studies that serve as benchmarks of PANDA's capabilities in the field of exotic hadron spectroscopy.",2017-08-21 12:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Workshop on Exotic Hadrons,Johan Messchendorp,

1382,Eighty Years of Research on Super-heavy Elements,"Professor Walter Greiner, our friend and teacher, passed away in the age of eighty. During his lifetime, the search for elements beyond uranium started and elements up to the so far heaviest one with atomic number 118 were discovered. In this talk I will present a short history from early searches for ‘trans-uraniums’ up to the production and safe identification of shell-stabilized ‘Super-Heavy Nuclei (SHN)’. The nuclear shell model reveals that these nuclei should be located in a region with closed shells for the protons at Z = 114, 120 or 126 and for the neutrons at N = 184. The outstanding aim of experimental investigations is the exploration of this region of spherical SHN. Systematic studies of heavy ion reactions for the synthesis of SHN revealed production cross-sections which reached values down to one picobarn and even below for the heaviest species. The systematics of measured cross-sections can be understood only on the basis of relatively high fission barriers as predicted for nuclei in and around the island of SHN. A key role in answering some of the open questions plays the synthesis of isotopes of element 120. Attempts aiming for synthesizing this element at the velocity filter SHIP will be reported.",2017-08-19 08:50:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,W.

1386,Cooling of Compact High Mass Twin Stars,"Existence of the  high mass pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348-0432 with masses of about 2 M_sun requires     a sufficiently stiff  equation of state (EoS) of the stellar matter to fulfill this constraint.     We succeeded to explain the thermal evolution of compact stars with stiff hadronic EoS in the framework of  the     ``nuclear medium cooling"" scenario. This requires an appropriate selection of proton gap profiles together with     properly defined medium corrections (effective pion gaps)[1].     Under the assumption that a phase transition to quark matter is possible for higher densities it is possible to describe     stable hybrid stars that form a third family of compact stars. In this case high-mass twin stars could exist     characterized by the same gravitational mass but different size.     We have investigated the features of cooling curves of such  possible high-mass twin-star sequences and show that     cooling scenarios could have a discriminating power for selecting optimal EoS models for compact stars.      	1.

Similarly to the low density nuclear liquid-gas phase transition, we show that such a phase transition is characterized by pure hadronic matter with both mechanical instability (fluctuations on the baryon density) that by chemical-diffusive instability (fluctuations on the strangeness concentration).    The analysis is performed by requiring the global conservation of baryon number and zero net strangeness in the framework of an effective relativistic mean field theory with the inclusion of the Delta(1232)-isobars, hyperons and the lightest pseudoscalar and vector meson degrees of freedom. It turns out that in this situation hadronic phases with different values of strangeness content may coexist, altering significantly baryon-antibaryon ratios.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,,Andrea Lavagno,
1388,Searching for magnetic monopoles with Solid State Breakdown Counters: from LHC to Space,"Solid state breakdown counters (SSBC) combine threshold properties of nuclear track detectors (NTDs) with the convenience of electronic event registration in real time. Their simple low-cost design, combined with high dE/dx thresholds, make them an attractive candidate for experiments searching for magnetic monopoles and other highly ionizing exotic particles. In one use case, the traditional NTDs could be “sandwiched” between two thin layers of segmented SSBCs. The SSBC would then provide an immediate feedback about the potential passage of a magnetic monopole, pinpointing the position of the track. That would drastically reduce the time needed to scan and analyze the NTD images. In this talk we describe the recently proposed variant of the SSBC that offers additional advantages. The prototype SSBCs are now being fabricated at the University of Alabama. They are anticipated to be deployed as a part of the MoEDAL experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Furthermore, the SSBC offers a unique opportunity to search for magnetic monopoles that can’t reach the Earth due to the geomagnetic cutoff. The talk also describes the joint effort of the Aerospace Engineering and Physics departments of the University of Alabama to deploy the SSBCs in the geosynchronous orbit using CubeSat satellites.",2017-08-18 13:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Mini-workshop on Highly Ionising Avatars of New Physics,Mini-workshop on Highly Ionising Avatars of New Physics,Igor Ostrovskiy,

At the same time the detector acceptance will be extended and new features such as a L1 track trigger will be implemented. Simulation studies evaluated the performance of the new, proposed detector components in comparison to the present detector.    The impact of the expected phase-2 performance on representative physics channels is studied. Several new studies were performed recently to evaluate in detail rare Higgs decays and Higgs couplings.

Nowadays intensive R&D activities in the field of MPGDs and their diversified applications are pursued by the large CERN- RD51 collaboration. The aims are to facilitate the development of advanced gas-avalanche detector concepts and technologies and associated electronic-readout systems, for applications in basic and applied research. MPGD systems now offer robustness, very high rate operation, high precision spatial resolution (sub 100-micron), and protection against discharges. MPGDs became important instruments in current particle-physics experiments and are in development and design stages for future ones. They are significant components of the upgrade plans for ATLAS, CMS, and ALICE at the LHC, exemplifying the beneficial transfer of detector technologies to industry. Beyond their design for experiments at future facilities (e.g. ILC), MPGDs are considered for rare-event searches, e.g. dark matter, double beta decay and neutrino scattering experiments. Detectors sensitive to x-rays, neutrons and light are finding applications in other diverse areas such as material sciences, hadron therapy systems, homeland security etc. The areas of research activities within the RD51 MPGD collaboration includes detector physics & technology, model simulations, readout electronics, production techniques, common test facilities, and applications. By this broad coverage RD51 brings together leading experts in the field of detector science and detectors users, resulting in effective progress over a wide array of applications.

1400,Quartet condensation in nuclear systems. A nuclear Quantum Phase Transition.,"It is shown that  low density nuclear matter is unstable with respect to alpha particle (quartet) formation. Since alpha particles are bosons, there occurs Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). We calculate the critical temperature and solve the orderparameter equation at zero temperature. It is demonstrated that there exists a critical density at which quartet condensation disappears. Density, therefore, triggers a quantum phase transition (QPT). This does not happen for pairing where no QPT as a function of density exists. Rather there is a smooth transition from BEC to the BCS regime.    The fameous Hoyle 0^+ state at 7.65 MeV in 12C will be identified as a precursor of alpha particle condensation. Applying this scenario to the Hoyle state all known experimental facts of the Hoyle state are well reproduced without adjustable parameter. This is in particular true for the inelastic form factor. Other possible Hoyle-like states in heavier self-conjugate nuclei will be identified.",2017-08-22 09:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,S.

The theoretical methods borrowed from macroscopic techniques turn out to be insufficient for finite systems such as nuclei. For example, weak pairing that inhibits Cooper phenomenon, particle number non-conservation, proximity of continuum states, strong coupling of collective modes, weak mean field,  all suggest the need for these theories to be revised.  In this presentation we tackle these problems; we take the path laid out by S.T. Belyaev and use equations of motion to couple the collectivities and to establish simple numerical procedures allowing for solutions with exact particle-number conservation. We use simple models and configuration interaction solutions to demonstrate the workings of proposed methods.",2017-08-22 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,S.

In 2013-2015 the injection facility of the collider has undergone an upgrade of the injection system. The new BINP injection complex has been  connected to the VEPP-2000 collider, so the restrictions connected to the lack of positrons and limited beam energy transfer do not apply any more. The collider luminosity in whole energy range is restricted now only by beam-beam effects. A maximal beam-beam parameter value $\xi$ achieved is about $0.12$. VEPP-2000 collider started to collect data with two detectors at 2016 year. The collected data sample since 2010 corresponds more than  $100\,pb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity per detector in the c.m. energy between $0.32$ and $2\,GeV$. We will report here results of analysis of various hadronic cross sections from detectors both published and preliminary. These measurements are important by themself and also because of the implications for anomaly of the magnetic moment of a muon ($g-2$) discrepancy.",2017-08-28 08:30:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Aleksandr Korol,

Chiral vortical effect (CVE) is the flow of axial current along the axis of rotation of the fluid while    the spin alignment is a non-vanishing correlation of polarizations of baryons with the axis of rotation.    As the theoretical framework we use the model of pionic superfluidity induced by a non-vanishing    isotopic chemical potential. We note that the average value of spin of virtual baryons reproduces    the CVE. The role of defects, or vortices is crucial.

At these regimes the Global Positioning System requieres relativistic corrections. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how does motion and gravity will affect long-range quantum experiments. Interestingly, relativistic effects can also be observed at small lengths scales. Some effects have been demonstrated in superconducting circuits involving boundary conditions moving at relativistic speeds and quantum clocks have been used to measure time dilation in table-top experiments. In this talk I will present a formalism for the study of gravitational effects on quantum technologies.  This formalism is also applicable in the development of new quantum technologies that can be used to deepen our understanding of physics in the overlap of quantum theory and relativity.

This phenomenon dramatically changes the dependence of the electron energy levels on magnetic field. In particular, the freezing of energy levels occurs so the ground energy level of light ions can never reach the lower continuum (become critical), no matter how strong the field is.    Therefore, the magnetic field affects the critical nucleus charge $Z_{\rm cr}$ in two ways: i. it makes the electron movement essencially one-dimensional diminishing the value of $Z_{\rm cr}$; ii. it makes the potential weaker increasing the value of critical charge.",2017-08-28 10:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,Walter Greiner Memorial session,Sergey Godunov,

1476,"Search for supersymmetry in events with one lepton, multiple jets and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV","A search for supersymmetry in events with a single electron or muon, hadronic jets and missing transverse momentum is presented. The data corespond to 35.9 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions recorded in 2016 by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The events are sorted into several exclusive search samples based on the number of jets and b-tagged jets, the scalar sum of the jet transverse momenta, and the scalar sum of the missing transverse momentum and the transverse momentum of the lepton. The numbers of events observed in all search samples are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes, and the results are used to set lower limits on superymmetric particle masses in the context of two simplified models of gluino pair production. In the first model, each gluino decays via a three- body process to a top quark-antiquark pair and a neutralino, which is assumed to escape udetected. Gluinos with masses up to 1.8 TeV are excluded for neutralino masses below 800 GeV. In the second model, each gluino decays via a three-body process to a light quark-antiquark pair and a chargino, which subsequently decays to a W boson and a neutralino. The mass of the chargino is taken to be midway between the gluino and neutralino masses. In this model, gluinos with masses below 1.9 TeV are excluded for neutralino masses below 300 GeV.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,Other Topics,Anna Stakia,

I will describe two newer directions of research springing from this idea. One is that gravitational solutions (such as black holes) can be constructed directly from the simpler solutions of Yang-Mills theories. To this end I will present a dictionary where each field in a supergravity theory is constructed as a convolution of two fields belonging to gauge theories. The dictionary is built to be automatically compatible with the equations of motion and as such there is hope that it can become a solution generating technique.    On the quantum side, I will describe how BRST quantization and the introduction of the associated ghosts lends itself to a double copy dictionary description.

The reflectivity of the target can be made negligible, and    the absorptivity is varied so that  the light pulse can reach the opposite side    of the pellet.

A variety of experiments have been developed over the past decades, aiming to detect Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) via their scattering in a detector medium. Exploiting directionality would also give a proof of the galactic origin of dark matter making it possible to have a clear and unambiguous signal to background separation. The directional detection of Dark Matter requires very sensitive experiment combined with highly performant technology. The NEWSdm experiment, based on nuclear emulsions, is proposed to measure the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils. We discuss the potentiality, both in terms of exclusion limits and potential discovery, of a directional experiment based on the use of a solid target made by newly developed nuclear emulsions and read-out systems reaching sub-micrometric resolution.",2017-08-29 08:00:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Parallel session,"D Cosmology, Astrophysics, Gravity, Mathematical Physics",Takashi Asada,

1497,Search for displaced lepton jets with the ATLAS experiment,"Several possible extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of a dark sector that is weakly coupled to the visible one: i.e. the two sectors couple via the vector portal, where a dark photon with mass in the MeV to GeV range mixes kinetically with the SM photon. If the dark photon is the lightest state in the dark sector, it will decay to SM particles, mainly to leptons and possibly light mesons. Due to its weak interactions with the SM, it can have a non-negligible lifetime. At the LHC, these dark photons would typically be produced with large boost resulting in collimated jet-like structures containing pairs of leptons and/or light hadrons, the so-called lepton-jets (LJs).    This work is focused on the search for â€œdisplaced LJsâ€, which are produced away from the interaction point and their constituents are limited to electrons, muons, and pions. The requested topology includes one or two LJs + leptons/jets/MET. The most recent ATLAS results based on samples collected at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV will be presented.    Results are interpreted in terms of the Falkowsky-Ruderman-Volansky-Zupan models where dark photons are generated through the decay of a Higgs boson to intermediate hidden fermions. The Higgs boson is supposed to be produced via gluon-fusion and for the first time, results are also presented in terms of the associated production of a Higgs boson with a W/Z and in the context of inelastic thermal relic dark matter.",2017-08-21 17:10:00+00:00,20 minutes,Poster,Poster session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Cristiano Sebastiani,

1504,On bimodal size distribution of spin clusters in the one-dimensional Ising model,"The size distribution of geometrical spin clusters is exactly found for the one-dimensional Ising model of finite extent. For the values of lattice constant $\beta$ above some “critical value” $\beta_c$ the found size distribution demonstrates the non-monotonic behavior with the peak corresponding to the size of the largest available cluster. In other words, for high values of the lattice constant there are two ways to fill the lattice: either to form a single largest cluster or to create many clusters of small sizes. This feature closely resembles    the well-know bimodal size distribution of clusters which is usually interpreted as a robust signal of the first order liquid-gas phase transition in finite systems. It is remarkable that the bimodal size distribution of spin clusters appears in the one-dimensional Ising model of finite size, i.e. in the model which in thermodynamic limit has no phase transition at all.",2017-08-21 17:10:00+00:00,20 minutes,Poster,Poster session,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Oleksii Ivanytskyi,

Initial results of the 13 TeV run have not yet revealed signals for new physics in ATLAS, CMS, LHCb    and MoEDAL. Of particular interest are searches for long lived particles, for which the the LHC detectors    have developed a comprehensive search program durign the past years.    Do these detectors allow us to search at all places where such  physics could show up?    In this presentation we look at some scenarios where small dedicated experiments will allow to considerably extend our search horizon. The explicite examples of the proposed MilliQan experiment    - a search for millicharge particles- and the MATHUSLA experiment  - a search for ultra-long lived particles that decay well outside the CMS and ATLAS detectors, will be discussed. These experiments are of    a similar type as the already approved and running MoEDAL experiment - a search for monopoles - which also considers the extension for searched for long lived particles",2017-08-25 08:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,A Particle Physics,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Albert DeRoeck UNKNOWN,

1511,Status of Advanced Virgo,"The LIGO and the Virgo collaborations have recently announced the first detections of Gravitational Waves. Due to their weak amplitude, Gravitational Waves are expected to produce a very small effect on free-falling masses, which undergo a displacement of the order of 10$^{-18}$ m for a Km-scale distance. This discovery showed that interferometric detectors are suitable to reveal such a feeble effect, and therefore represent a new tool for astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology in the understanding of the Universe.    To better reconstruct the direction of the Gravitational Wave source and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the events by means of multiple coincidence, a network of detectors is necessary.    In the USA, the LIGO project is currently carrying its second Observation Run (O2) with a couple of twin 4 kilometer-long arms detectors which are placed in Washington State and Louisiana.    Advanced VIRGO (AdV) is a 3 kilometer-long arms second generation interferometer situated in Cascina, near Pisa in Italy.

We then consider a specific N=1 model in four dimensions with fluxes turned on, and we determine the subset of the    space-filling 3-branes of the maximal theory that are not projected out in the model. We point out that all such branes can simultaneously be included to cancel the tadpoles induced by the fluxes, giving in principle many new solutions to the consistency conditions that these    fluxes must satisfy.",2017-08-28 09:40:00+00:00,45 minutes,Talk,"Workshop on (Super)gravity, String theory and Related Topics","Workshop on Supergravity, Strings and Related Matters",Fabio Riccioni,

To this end, the data must be appropriately tuned and the way to proceed is inspired from gravitational self-duality. The set-up under consideration admits a non-trivial flat limit, in which the asymptotically flat spacetime emerges as a resummed series based on data defined on a two-dimensional space-like surface. These data can be thought of as a Carrollean fluid obeying energy conservation law and Euler-like equations.    Compared to previous attempts, the present approach provides a more general and robust perspective on flat-space holography for fluids. I will illustrate it with the Robinson-Trautman family of Einstein spacetimes, showing in particular that the dissipation phenomena occurring in the corresponding relativistic and Carrollean fluids are due to thermal conduction, where the two-dimensional Gauss    curvature plays the role of a temperature.",2017-08-28 15:00:00+00:00,45 minutes,Talk,"Workshop on (Super)gravity, String theory and Related Topics","Workshop on Supergravity, Strings and Related Matters",Marios Petropoulos,

We measured the correlation functions of the energy-momentum tensor in the range of temperatures $T/T_c \in [0.9, 1.5]$ and extracted shear viscosity using two approaches. The first one was to fit the lattice data with a physically motivated ansatz for the spectral function with unknown parameters and then determine the shear viscosity. The second approach was to apply the Backus-Gilbert method allowing to extract the shear viscosity from the lattice data nonparametrically. The results obtained within both approaches agree with each other. Our results allow us to conclude that within the range $T/T_c \in [0.9, 1.5]$ the $SU(3)$--gluodynamics reveals the properties of a strongly interacting system, which cannot be described perturbatively, and has the ratio η/s close to the value $1 / 4 \pi$ of the $N = 4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.",2017-08-19 13:55:00+00:00,25 minutes,Talk,Special Session on QCD,A High Energy Particle Physics:,Nikita Astrakhantsev,

However, description of such a fast thermalization is a challenging task by itself, since kinetics seems to be non-applicable at such a time scale. One of the possible approaches to the problem is the Unruh effect [1], that has been proposed in [2, 3, 4]. Here we try to apply the idea to the heavy ion collisions using the UrQMD model. Particles are considered as generated at the Unruh horizon thus allowing to estimate the Unruh temperature of the source. The analysis was provided for different types of mesons and their charge.

1548,From Acceleration Radiation to Black Hole Entropy: A quantum optical perspective,"Acceleration radiation is caused by virtual processes in which an atom jumps from the ground state to an excited state, together with the emission of a photon. If an atom is accelerated away from the original point of virtual emission then there is a small probability that the virtual photon will ""get away"". When ground-state atoms are accelerated through a high Q microwave cavity, radiation is produced with an intensity which can exceed the intensity of acceleration radiation in free space by many orders of magnitude. The reason is a strong nonadiabatic effect at cavity boundaries [1].        By formulating acceleration radiation as a flat space quantum optics problem one can obtain the entropy of a black hole (BH). Using this approach we find the famous Bekenstein-Hawking BH entropy formula via a simple ""laser-like"" density matrix analysis. In this way we calculate the entropy of the radiation emitted by a cloud of infalling atoms without introducing the BH temperature [2].    [1]. M.O. Scully, V.V. Kocharovsky, A. Belyanin, E.

1551,Latest results on azimuthal anisotropy at RHIC-PHENIX,"Relativistic heavy ion collisions are a unique way to form the quark gluon plasma (QGP). Measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of particle production in relativistic heavy ion collisions have been used to study the initial condition and the relativistic hydrodynamic response of the hot and dense matter. The hydrodynamical response of the QGP to a given initial condition can be studied by selecting different collision systems. For this purpose, symmetric Au+Au/Cu+Cu and asymmetric Cu+Au collisions have been operated at RHIC, and the azimuthal anisotropy strength v_n have been measured in these collision systems.     In addition, RHIC has operated small collision systems, p/d/3^He+Au collisions which have been considered too small to form the QGP. Although a finite v_n has been considered to arise from the strong hydrodynamical expansion, recent measurements of v_n in the small collision systems at RHIC show similar strengths as seen in heavy ion collisions. Measurements of v_n in small collision systems could provide a better understanding of the hydrodynamical limit and other mechanisms which cause the large anisotropy in small collision systems.      In this poster, we will present the latest results on azimuthal anisotropies in symmetric and asymmetric heavy ion collisions as well as small colliding systems at PHENIX.",2017-08-21 16:30:00+00:00,1 hour,Poster,Poster session,B Heavy Ion Collisions and Critical Phenomena,Ralf Seidl,
1553,From Acceleration Radiation to Black Hole Entropy: A Quantum Optical Perspective,"Acceleration radiation is caused by virtual processes in which an atom jumps from the ground state to an excited state, together with the emission of a photon. If an atom is accelerated away from the original point of virtual emission then there is a small probability that the virtual photon will ""get away"". When ground-state atoms are accelerated through a high Q microwave cavity, radiation is produced with an intensity which can exceed the intensity of acceleration radiation in free space by many orders of magnitude (see Fig. 1a,b at http://iqse.tamu.edu/figure/Figure.pdf). The reason is a strong nonadiabatic effect at cavity boundaries [1].        By formulating acceleration radiation as a flat space quantum optics problem one can obtain the entropy of a black hole (BH). Using this approach we find the famous Bekenstein-Hawking BH entropy formula via a simple ""laser-like"" density matrix analysis (see Fig. 1c at http://iqse.tamu.edu/figure/Figure.pdf). In this way we calculate the entropy of the radiation emitted by a cloud of infalling atoms without introducing the BH temperature [2].     [1]. M.O. Scully, V.V. Kocharovsky, A. Belyanin, E.

1555,Challenges and approaches of unveiling the nature of antimatter at CERN (with a particular focus on the AEgIS experiment),"Unraveling the nature of antimatter is an ongoing quest on the frontiers of physics. Even though the existence of antimatter has been known since the early 1930s, there is still much to be learned about the nature of this elusive type of particles — in particular, which differences between matter and antimatter renders the observable universe possible. The Antimatter Factory at CERN has been built for this purpose and is currently host to five experiments, the majority of which create antihydrogen as the main pathway to investigating the apparent matter-antimatter asymmetry. The talk will present an introduction to antimatter physics and the Antiproton Decelerator facility, including such as setup of a typical antimatter experiment, methods to create antihydrogen, selected results in the history of antimatter research and future measurements and prospects. A particular focus will be given to the AEgIS experiment, aiming for a first precise direct measurement of the gravitational behaviour of antimatter; to test the Weak Equivalence Principle with antimatter in Earth’s gravitational field.",2017-08-29 07:00:00+00:00,30 minutes,Talk,Workshop on Future of Fundamental Physics,Workshop on Future of Fundamental Physics - Accelerators in HEP and beyond,Lillian Smestad,
